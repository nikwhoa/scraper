<p class='speakable'>Jacoba Ballard was compelled to take a 23andMe DNA test when she made a shocking discovery that
    would be <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/netflix' target='_blank'>the subject of a Netflix
        documentary</a>.</p>
<p class='speakable'>It was 2014 and <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/indiana'
        target='_blank'>the Indiana woman who was donor-conceived</a> was curious if she, an only child, had any
    half-siblings. Over eight years, the 43-year-old discovered she had at least 94 brothers and sisters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least seven of them lived within a 25-mile radius of her. They all shared a biological father — fertility doctor
    Donald Cline — who had been artificially inseminating his patients with his own sperm without their consent or
    knowledge.</p>
<p>The story of Ballard’s discovery, as well as her half siblings' quest to seek justice, is the subject of <a
        href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/streaming' target='_blank'>'Our Father,' which is
        streaming now</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            'IT WAS SURREAL'</strong></a></p>
<p>Director Lucie Jourdan told Fox News Digital that filming began in 2017 after a passionate Ballard was determined to
    share her story publicly in hopes of raising awareness on laws that can be passed to protect patients. But not all
    the siblings were initially on board to share their accounts.</p>

<p>'Jacoba was all for it, but we had to earn the other siblings’ trust,' Jourdan explained. 'They were wary. We
    dedicated years to making sure that they felt comfortable with us as we listened to their stories and started
    digging in and investigating Cline ourselves. I needed to tell this story to help Jacoba get a voice. Yes, the story
    is about a fertility doctor, but this is a story about consent for women. And that was my driving force in making
    the film.</p>

<p>'A lot of them were motivated to speak out by the fact there were no laws to protect mothers,' Jourdan added. 'It was
    incredibly brave of them to speak out, share their stories and identify this man. And I think his audacity in trying
    to keep them quiet was also a motivating factor for them … This story is a warning.'</p>
<p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court' target='_blank'>Court documents allege</a>
    Cline told six adults believed to be his biological children that he had donated his own sperm about 50 times
    because he was trying to help his patients and didn’t have access to fresh sperm. The Indianapolis-based fertility
    doctor had told his patients they were receiving sperm from medical or dental residents or medical students and that
    no single donor’s sperm was used more than three times, according to court records.</p>

<p>Jourdan said we may never know the true motive behind Cline’s actions.</p>
<p>'I will say candidly that the why has never mattered in this story,' she explained. 'His point of view doesn’t
    matter. It has always been my intent to document the fallout of what he did to show how someone can affect the lives
    of so many people negatively. I wanted to hold their stories up … I do believe this is sexual assault, a sexual
    violation.'</p>
<p>Shereen Farber, whose twin daughters were fathered by Cline, described how the disgraced medic delivered her

<p>'She had this horrified look on her face as she said, ‘How can you be angry when you had what you’ve always wanted?’'
    said Jourdan. 'But there was such a <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family'
        target='_blank'>psychological fallout that impacted these families</a>. It’s heartbreaking. Many of the parents

</div>
<p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/documentary' target='_blank'>The documentary
        revealed</a> how Cline was viewed as a religious, devoted family man in his community. He was known for helping
    heterosexual couples who yearned to become parents. It is believed he carried out his deeds during the ‘70s and ’80s
    without repercussions. Many of the siblings, blonde and blue-eyed, have even wondered if Cline was trying to breed
    the 'perfect Aryan clan' as a possible motive.</p>
<p>'The siblings were left in the dark,' said Jourdan. 'When your reality is completely shattered, you search for
    answers. I’m not going to comment my opinion on that because, again, it does not matter here. But I think they were
    trying to piece everything together. But as one of the children said in the documentary, ‘If he would just tell us
    why we wouldn’t have to have conspiracy theories to guide us.’ And I think that’s really the point. He gave them
    nothing. So they were frantically searching for answers. They’re still hurting.'</p>
<p>In 2017, <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime' target='_blank'>Cline avoided jail time for lying</a>
    about using his own sperm to impregnate as many as dozens of women after telling them the donors were anonymous.
    Cline was given a one-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice. No
    other charges were filed against him because Indiana law doesn’t specifically prohibit fertility doctors from using
    their own sperm.</p>

<p>Cline was charged after lying to investigators, and he faced up to three years in prison on each count. The charges
    stemmed from two confirmed cases of paternity. Cline, who retired in 2009, initially denied the allegations when he
    wrote to investigators, saying that the women who filed the complaints were trying to slander him. He later
    acknowledged that he lied. Cline mentioned only the two women who first filed complaints. He didn’t discuss his
    decision to use his own sperm decades ago.</p>

<p>Cline also didn’t respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Since the release of 'Our Father,' Jourdan said it’s likely the number of siblings will 'continue to soar' as <a
        href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/viral' target='_blank'>the story has gone viral</a>.
    She described how some of the siblings have even grown closer and become 'fiercely protective' of each other.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But, more importantly, there’s a sense of relief that they’re being heard. And now, they hope the film will persuade
    Indiana lawmakers, as well as other legislatures across the country, to pass a measure that would deem a fertility
    doctor’s <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime' target='_blank'>use of his own sperm a crime.</a></p>
<p>'I am really hopeful that things will change because of this film,' Jourdan said. 'And I do believe the laws will
    change. There’s no doubt that this is a sexual violation. This is about autonomy over one’s body. There is outrage.
    And people are finally listening.'</p>
