<p class='speakable'>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said the newly passed Inflation Reduction Act will improve living conditions in America and criticized the recent spike in flight cancellations across the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p class='speakable'>'Obviously, we're very encouraged to see that 0% increase in CPI, but that's just one month. So nobody's spiking the football here,' Buttigieg told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview at Port Tampa Bay in Florida Tuesday while promoting a new $12.6 million grant. 'What we need to see is a sustained cooling of that inflationary pressure and it can't come soon enough.'</p><p>Buttigieg said the act will help lower costs for Americans, as the annual inflation rate has reached 9.1% for the past 12-month period that ended in June, according to data published in July by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the Inflation Reduction Act would have a 'negligible' effect on inflation in 2022, and very little effect on inflation in 2023, depending on other factors like the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;</p><p>But Buttigieg said the act would help alleviate the pain of inflation by lowering the costs of things like prescription drugs, insulin for Medicare subscribers, home utility bills, and electric vehicles.</p><p></p><p>'These are measures that make it more affordable to live in America, and that is part of the solution when it comes to inflation,' Buttigieg said.</p><div baseimage='https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg' source='Reuters Photos' class='image-ct inline'><div class='m'><picture><source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/343/192/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/686/384/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'><source media='(min-width: 767px) and (max-width: 1023px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/672/378/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/1344/756/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'><source media='(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1279px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/931/523/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/1862/1046/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'><source media='(min-width: 1280px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/720/405/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/1440/810/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'> <img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/640/320/PETE-BUTTIGIEG-WH-PRESS-BRIEFING.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Nov. 8, 2021.'></picture></div> </div><p>Buttigieg also touted the Department of Transportation's work backing passengers whose flights have been canceled over the last several months.
