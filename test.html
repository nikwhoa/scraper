Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), and spin away last week’s defeats in Georgia.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We are sweeping everything. We actually did great in Georgia,” the former president said, pointing out that his endorsed candidate for lieutenant governor had eked out a win. “All the congressmen, all the congresspeople, we swept everything.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He wasn’t wrong. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/trump-endorsements-republican-primaries/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11'>Trump-endorsed candidates</a> had prevailed or made runoffs in federal races. He was, obviously, misleading — in the most closely-watched contests, Trump-backed candidates for governor and secretary of state got crushed. And he was in Wyoming, holding either the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/29/trump-wyoming-cheney/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11'>biggest rally in its history</a> or one of the biggest, because he wanted to crush Cheney and purge more enemies from the GOP.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But in the primaries in the weeks ahead, there's much more to watch than just what happens to Trump's endorsees. This isn't a rundown of every election coming up this summer — certainly not all the races you'll see covered in The Trailer. It's a guide to seven days on the summer calendar that are going to impact or inform most everything else that happens this year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>June 7.</strong> In California, one of seven states holding primaries or local elections that day, three races will tell us how voters are viewing the criminal justice reform movement.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The recall effort against San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin has <a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco-crime/629907/'>gotten most</a> of the national attention, a function of the outsize attention the city gets from conservative media and of Boudin’s unlikely rise to power — born to Weather Underground radicals, victorious in a ranked-choice election just eight years after leaving Yale Law School and <a href='https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/exclusive-two-sf-prosecutors-quit-join-effort-to-oust-former-boss-district-attorney-chesa-boudin/2698511/'>abandoned</a> by longtime prosecutors who want him gone.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But that’s one of several June 7 races revolving around crime. In Los Angeles, billionaire developer Rick Caruso’s <a href='https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/how-rick-caruso-spent-23-78-million-on-his-mayoral-campaign/'>spending</a> has transformed the race for race for mayor. Countywide, Sheriff Alex Villanueva is <a href='https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-23/l-a-sheriffs-race-villanueva-name-recognition'>seeking</a> a second term over challengers who say he has picked fights and staged clear-outs of homeless camps without actually fixing problems. In Orange County, District Attorney Todd Spitzer, a Republican, faces <a href='https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-12/todd-spitzers-missteps-could-provide-opening-for-two-opponents-in-oc-das-race'>multiple challengers </a>who want to drag him into a November runoff. They got an opening after some of Spitzer's endorsers walked away, following revelations of racist comments he'd made when prosecuting an old case. But <a href='https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-16/laguna-woods-gunman-worked-methodically-but-motive-a-mystery'>since this month's mass shooting</a> at a Taiwanese church in the county, Spitzer has been front and center in the investigation.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>June 11.</strong> It’s round one of Alaska’s <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/16/palin-campaign-alaska/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20'>special House election</a>, where dozens of candidates are battling for four slots in an Aug. 16 runoff. Trump has endorsed former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) to replace the late Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), but 11 other Republicans stayed on the ballot, and a few outside liberal groups are waiting to see who emerges to determine whether it’s worth spending money there.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>June 14.</strong> Republicans get their first chance this year to shrink the Democratic majority in the House — a special election in Texas’s 34th Congressional District.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Until 2020, a district connecting San Antonio’s Bexar County to the border city of Brownsville wasn’t even worth the trouble for Republicans, as the district backed Democratic presidential nominees by 20 points or more. But the GOP’s success in the Rio Grande Valley had an impact here, and after President Biden carried the seat by just 4 points ex-Rep. Filemon Vela, a moderate Democrat, began his move to the private sector.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Vela resigned two months ago, allowing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to set up a quick special election that pitted Mayra Flores, who had just won the GOP nomination for November, against Dan Sanchez, a Democrat from the district’s most populous county.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The conditions for a GOP upset are practically ideal — new lines that shift the district considerably toward Democrats won’t be used until November, and Sanchez is running because the party’s general election candidate, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Tex.), is currently representing the 15th Congressional District and can’t run for both. Republicans have published internal polling that shows Flores up by single digits, and the libertarian-leaning group FreedomWorks just made a six-figure buy there.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>(Republicans are also hopeful that they can win New York's 19th Congressional District, which New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado (D) vacated to take up his new role, but the state has not yet set that special election date.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>June 16.</strong> The Supreme Court’s nine justices will <a href='https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-1271.html'>meet to discuss</a><i> Moore v. Harper</i>, the redistricting complaint brought by North Carolina Republicans after the state Supreme Court struck down a GOP-friendly congressional map and imposed a more competitive one.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The short-term stakes in that case lowered dramatically two months ago; the court <a href='https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/03/justices-decline-to-reinstate-gop-backed-congressional-voting-maps-in-north-carolina-pennsylvania/'>declined</a> to block the court order, and allowed the 2022 election to take place on the new maps. But if this case stays on the court’s agenda, it will offer the conservative majority its first attempt to weigh in on the idea that the Constitution gives state legislatures, and no other actors, the power to draw electoral maps. A decision would come later in the year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>June 28.</strong> Primaries in Colorado, Oklahoma and Utah on this day are shaping up as factional battles inside the GOP, with little involvement so far from Trump. In Colorado, especially, there's a sense of deja vu — Republicans lost the 2010 races for governor and U.S. Senate, when everything else was going their way, with weak nominees who were, respectfully, abandoned by the party and weakened by gaffes.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After the state convention, the GOP race to challenge Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) has narrowed to University of Colorado regent Heidi Ganahl and businessman Greg Lopez, who has <a href='https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2022/05/co-governor-candidate-greg-lopezs-advice-for-pregnant-rape-victims-really-evaluate-how-this-might-change-for-the-positive/45645/'>already been targeted</a> by Democrats over his no-exceptions view of abortion rights if <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is overturned. Three Republicans are seeking the U.S. Senate nomination, but state Rep. Ron Hanks (R), who traveled to Arizona to view the GOP-led review of the 2020 election, had the most support at the convention. Many national Republicans believe construction company CEO Joe O'Dea would have the best chance of beating Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.).&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Similar races are unfolding in the other states; some of the Utah conservatives challenging incumbents who didn't vote the way Trump wanted on Jan. 6, 2021, actually showed up in Casper to get face time with Trump's team. In Oklahoma, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) is being challenged by pastor Jackson Lahmeyer, in large part over his own vote to affirm the 2020 election. Over the state border, in Nebraska, voters will elect a replacement for ex-Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R), who resigned after being convicted of campaign finance violations. That race, between two state legislators with credible campaigns, will give us a test.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>July 8.</strong> This is the first of several days when members of the Democratic National Committee will meet to determine which states <a href='https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2022/04/13/iowa-democratic-caucus-dnc-calendar-could-lose-first-nation-2024-elections/9498398002/'>vote in which order</a> for their 2024 primaries. Iowa Democrats have approached the process with brio and gritted teeth, watching Democrats in Nevada, Michigan and less-White and more politically competitive states pitch DNC members on schedules that would let them vote first. Their decision won't affect the midterms — but it will mean a lot to local Democrats trying to raise money and ambitious Democrats who, after decades of building ties to Iowa activists, may want to start getting to know the grass roots in another state, with more competitive 2022 races.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>Aug. 2.</strong> The well-funded effort to beat left-wing Democrats in primaries has been leading up to this — primaries in Michigan and Missouri, where both Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) are running in re-shaped districts. A new PAC, Urban Empowerment Action, is <a href='https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-recast/2022/05/27/scoop-pac-to-spend-1m-to-oust-squad-member-talib-00035738'>already planning</a> a million-dollar investment to beat Tlaib in Detroit, and state Sen. Steve Roberts has gotten some interest from national groups despite being <a href='https://theintercept.com/2022/04/19/missouri-steven-roberts-groping-allegation-settlement/'>accused of rape</a> by a Democratic candidate who died under unexplained circumstances, weeks before he announced his run.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>Aug. 16. </strong>Primaries in Wyoming and Alaska will give Trump his last real tests this year of his ability to move Republican votes; he has endorsed challengers to Cheney and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who'll both face voters that day. There's no runoff law in Wyoming, which Cheney's opponents see as an advantage for her; in Alaska, polls have found both Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka favored to win two of the four slots in the state's new ranked-choice runoff system.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><strong>Aug. 18. </strong>There will be another gut-check for the Democratic Party's left in Pittsburgh, where the 16th annual Net roots Nation conference will unfold in person after two years of remote meetings. Over the years, it's has moved further and further away from the “cattle call” format that brings so much attention to events like the Conservative Political Action Conference, where potential presidential candidates gather in one place and reporters park their laptops in front of them.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the conference always says plenty about where Democrats are going. Long before conservatives started joking about the left putting “pronouns in bios,” Net roots was setting up all-gender bathrooms and putting preferred pronouns on nametags. Three years ago, in Philadelphia, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) clearly had the most support among the thousands of liberal activists who showed up; Biden, whose campaign headquarters was a few blocks away, had almost none. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) skipped the conference in favor of a solidarity rally with striking nurses. How frustrated is the left? This is a good weekend to find out.</p><h3 data-qa='article-header' class=' pb-sm pt-lgmod' id='BJV7MKXXANETJIBDJOAHF74H2Q'><div>Reading list</div></h3><div data-qa='article-image' class='hide-for-print'><div style='min-height:358px'></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/29/trump-wyoming-cheney/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48'><strong>“After Georgia losses, Trump sets sights on ousting Cheney in Wyoming,”</strong></a><strong> by David Weigel and Josh Dawsey</strong></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The next episode in the impeachment revenge saga.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-30/california-june-primary-is-largely-about-races-far-down-the-ballot'><strong>“The suspense in California’s June 7 primary election is in races far down the ballot,”</strong></a><strong> by Phil Willon and Seema Mehta</strong></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Big consequences for voters who haven't tuned in.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/28/louie-gohmert/?itid=lk_inline_manual_52'><strong>“Some far-right members are being replaced by traditional conservatives,”</strong></a><strong> by Paul Kane</strong></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The impact of de-Gohmertification.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/05/29/utah-republicans-court/'><strong>“For Utah Republican candidates, Trump is still king at Wyoming rally,” </strong></a><strong>by Bryan Schott</strong></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Inside the MAGA road show.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://boltsmag.org/amendment-c-south-dakota-medicaid/#.YpWR_sgyPhc.twitter'><strong>“GOP rushes to change election rules to block Medicaid in South Dakota,”</strong></a><strong> by Quinn Yeargain</strong></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A push to make it harder for voters to pass what the GOP state legislature wouldn't pass.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/28/trump-gop-influence-defeats-sundaytake/?itid=lk_inline_manual_58'><strong>“Trump is trapped in the past, and it’s hurting him with GOP voters,”</strong></a><strong> by Dan Balz</strong></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Three weeks and three lost primaries.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/nyregion/jerry-nadler-carolyn-maloney.html'><strong>“Maloney vs. Nadler?

That was the reaction Amash was going for: He'd been reading from “Liberalism,” a book by the late Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, “one of my heroes” and the namesake of an anti-woke caucus that was about to take the party over.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Just five years after its founding, the Mises Caucus <a href='https://reason.com/2021/06/23/inside-the-battle-over-the-soul-of-the-libertarian-party/'>triumphed</a> at the Memorial Day weekend convention, electing Los Angeles Libertarian Party chair Angela McArdle to lead the national party on the first ballot. Accepting the job, McArdle promised to make the 50-year old party into a “force to be reckoned with,” channeling the ideas and energy of movements that were giving hope to free-thinkers and government skeptics.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“People are getting paid in bitcoin,” McArdle told delegates on Saturday. “Truckers and nurses led protests for freedom. Peaceful secession is actually being discussed all across the political spectrum. There's a growing food freedom and medical freedom movement. And we're blessed to live in the information age, where it's easier to spread our message.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The battle for the LP <a href='https://reason.com/2021/06/23/inside-the-battle-over-the-soul-of-the-libertarian-party/'>unfolded</a> over Twitter and virtual conventions, web forums and podcasts, after three presidential campaigns where the party nominated ex-Republicans for president and grew its share of the popular vote. But there had always been resistance inside the party to Libertarian-come-latelys like ex-Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Critics didn't just have ideological disputes with those candidates, who overcame more radical Libertarian candidates to win. (The 2016 candidate debate, when some <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PioXdolPGCw'>delegates booed</a> Johnson for saying he was okay with drivers' licenses, sums that up.) After 2016, especially, they had strategic disputes. Under ex-chair Nicholas Sarwark, during Johnson's two campaigns, the party was positioning itself as a haven for independents who wanted refuge from an increasingly nationalist GOP and increasingly left-wing Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Courage. Bravery. Those are things that animate people,” caucus founder Michael Heise <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPINc7cwP5U'>said in a speech </a>at the 2021 “Liberty Speaks” gathering. “Ron Paul in front of a bunch of conservatives had the audacity to say we should legalize heroin. He got a bunch of conservatives to cheer that on.” He contrasted that with how Johnson moderated his stance on drug legalization, using the rare forum of a CNN town hall to say that he only favored legalizing marijuana.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Mises-minded Libertarians <a href='https://reason.com/2021/06/23/inside-the-battle-over-the-soul-of-the-libertarian-party/'>took over local parties</a>, they made noise, taking positions and issuing tweets that generated controversy — which was the point. A <a href='https://twitter.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1404633207941832706'>now-deleted tweet</a> from the New Hampshire party read “John McCain's brain tumor saved Anthony S. Fauci,” and that approach rankled the coastal, more socially liberal faction that had been running the party. The fight over whether to recognize a breakaway faction of the New Hampshire party ended with a win for the Mises caucus and the <a href='https://www.washingtonblade.com/2021/08/18/gay-d-c-libertarian-party-leader-resigns-as-natl-chair/'>resignation</a> of the national party chair, who's since changed his own registration from Libertarian to independent.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That momentum, for the party's right flank, surged in 2020, with Mises-aligned Libertarians mobilizing against covid-19 mandates — and bemoaning how the old leadership didn't capitalize on anti-mandate energy. (The party's 2020 convention <a href='https://twitter.com/angela4LNCChair/status/1530612621870649345'>observed social distancing</a> rules, which McArdle mocked after her victory this weekend.) McArdle took a large public role in opposing Los Angeles County's restrictions, <a href='https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/health/2022/02/10/la-organization-launches-petition-to-repeal-vaccination-requirement'>organizing</a> a campaign to ban vaccine mandates altogether.&nbsp;</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a memo <a href='https://angelamcardle.com/'>sketching out</a> how she'd lead the LP, McArdle wrote that “good, strong messaging grows strong libertarians and libertarian affiliates” and “creates new donors and members.” Nominating people with political profiles who would shy from the party's most radical ideas wouldn't win adherents.

That's helped him with an electorate that's fairly gloomy overall — most independents say that the state and economy are headed in the wrong direction, but a plurality of them approve of Lamont.
