<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>Utah voters who
    tuned into Monday night’s Senate debate were treated to something relatively rare in the 2022 election: a candidate
    putting Jan. 6, 2021, front and center in his closing argument. Independent Evan McMullin seized upon texts Sen.
    Mike Lee (R-Utah) sent to the White House indicating a willingness to help President Donald Trump contest the 2020
    election results, saying Lee “betrayed your oath to the Constitution.”</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>Despite the
    well-publicized Jan. 6 hearings, including the likely final one, held last week, the insurrection has not been an
    overarching focus of Democrats’ 2022 campaign messaging. Politico reported last week that Jan. 6 has featured in
    less than 2 percent of ads run for House Democrats.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>This lacuna in their
    messaging comes even as most House Republicans supported Trump’s baseless last-ditch election challenges that led to
    the attack on the Capitol, and even as a majority of the GOP’s most prominent candidates have either denied or
    questioned the 2020 election results.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>Indeed, a new poll
    reinforces that Democrats haven’t really driven the argument home. Many Americans view Trump as a major threat to
    democracy. But the Republican Party more broadly? Not so much.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>A New York
    Times/Siena College poll shows that 45 percent of Americans regard Trump as a “major” threat to democracy, while
    just 28 percent say the same of the GOP.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>That 28 percent
    figure is actually smaller than the percentage who view the Democratic Party as a threat to democracy (33 percent) —
    despite there being no comparable example of Democrats trying to overturn an election. (And no, Stacey Abrams and
    Hillary Clinton aren’t analogous.)</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>Some of this is
    partisanship — along with Republicans’ successful attempts to play up the issue of voter fraud, despite the utter
    lack of evidence that it’s a major problem in American elections. Polls have long shown Republicans and Democrats
    view the other side as a threat to democracy, but for very different reasons.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>But if you dig a
    little deeper, you’ll see that isn’t the full story: It’s also the case that many <i>Democratic</i> voters haven’t
    been convinced that the problem goes beyond Trump.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>The poll shows that
    71 percent of Trump 2020 voters regard Democrats as a major threat to democracy. But just 52 percent of Biden voters
    say the same about the GOP.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>And independents are
    significantly more likely to view Democrats as a major threat than Republicans. Although more than 6 in 10 view each
    party as at least a minor threat, just 23 percent view the GOP as a major threat, while 31 percent say the same of
    Democrats. Independents are actually more likely to view voting by mail as a major threat to democracy (31 percent)
    than the GOP.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>The findings aren’t
    wholly surprising, given that polling late last year showed Americans generally were split on which party was a
    bigger threat to democracy. But given all what we’ve learned since then from the Jan. 6 hearings, along with all the
    evidence that the GOP has come to be defined by election denial, it’s striking that this appears to be more of a
    muted issue for Democratic voters — at least when it comes to the choice before them on Nov. 8.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>As Dan Balz wrote
    last week after the Jan. 6 hearing:</p>
<blockquote
    class='blockquote border-box black font--article-body pl-sm pl-md-ns bc-black b bl cb mb-md mt-sm-ns mb-lg-mod-ns'>
    <div class='' data-qa='article-quote'>The connection between the attack and the midterm elections couldn’t be
        clearer. The committee’s hearings have established that President Donald Trump was prepared before the 2020
        election to call foul if he lost — that he willfully ignored aides who told him after the voting that he had
        lost, then brazenly brushed aside those who told him his conspiracies about widespread fraud were unfounded and
        sometimes ludicrous. Trump continues to traffic in these same false claims today.</div>
    <div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'>Meanwhile, hundreds of Republican candidates who have bought into the lie
        that the election was stolen are on ballots this fall. If they win, they pose potential threats to future
        elections. The threats will become even more serious if an unadmonished Trump becomes the party’s 2024
        presidential nominee.</div>
</blockquote>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>Part of the
    difficulty for Democrats is that these issues are difficult to prosecute and pin down. While many Republicans played
    into Trump’s election lies and supported his efforts to challenge the election to the Supreme Court and on Jan. 6,
    they often offered a more watered-down version of the case Trump made. Some have backed off the “stolen” election
    talk, to some degree. And most of the candidates who went all-in on the stolen election talk are running for safely
    Republican seats, with a few notable exceptions (see: Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania; Kari Lake, Blake Masters and
    Mark Finchem in Arizona; and Jim Marchant in Nevada).</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>This issue might
    loom for Trump in a 2024 campaign, given that independents are significantly more likely to view Trump as a major
    threat to democracy (47 percent) than anybody else.</p>
<p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css font-copy'>But the integrity of
    the democratic process is something Democrats and the Jan. 6 committee have pitched as being of the utmost
    importance — going to the core of who we are as a country. Yet at this point, with just half of Biden voters and
    one-quarter of independents saying the GOP is a major threat to democracy, it’s clearly not something they’ve
    convinced voters is truly at stake in 2022.</p><br>
