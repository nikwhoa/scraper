    data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\"> The EU named a Russian national – Mikhail Potepkin – and
    Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group subsidiary in Sudan, Meroe Gold, listing them “for serious human rights abuses,
    including torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings, in several countries, including
    Sudan,” according a statement published Saturday on the EC’s legal platform EUR-LEX. </p>

    data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\"> “Mikhail Potepkin is the director of Meroe Gold, a front
    company for the Wagner Group’s operations in Sudan, and is involved in the activities of M-Invest, Meroe’s parent
    company. He has a leadership role in the Wagner Group in Sudan and has close ties to Yevgeny Prigozhin,” according
    to a statement from the European Council. </p>

    data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\"> The evidence also suggested that Russia colluded with
    Sudan’s beleaguered military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and to
    deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue. </p>
