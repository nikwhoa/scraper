<p class='speakable'>An ominous development in American politics is the explicit marriage of abortion advocacy to
    corporate interests, as the progressive movement and its pro-abortion base have grown increasingly strident and
    extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class='speakable'>In the Dobbs era, there seems to be a competition over which company can be the most pro-abortion.
    Scores of CEOs are practically tripping over one another to announce that they will pay travel expenses for
    employees who get an out-of-state abortion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pro-abortion advocates claim that allowing the people to have a say about protecting unborn children and their
    pregnant mothers written into law&nbsp;— saving potentially millions of lives —&nbsp;is 'highly destabilizing for
    businesses.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting to include provisions that promote abortion within a company’s 'Environmental, Social and
    Governance' (ESG) policies. ESG analyzes companies and assigns a score, based on social and political policies that
    have nothing to do with core business activities. Under this mantle, extreme policies have quietly been adopted by
    the largest fund managers in America, including BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abortion on demand until birth, imposed by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, has long been a gift to companies
    looking for an excuse not to implement or prioritize family-friendly policies. So it’s no surprise many of the same
    companies that eagerly cover abortion-related expenses mistreat their employees, particularly women
    —&nbsp;discriminating against pregnant workers and exposing female employees to unsafe working conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon, for example, announced in May that it would pay up to $4,000 each year to cover abortion-related travel. Yet
    that same month, the State of New York filed a complaint against Amazon for reportedly forcing pregnant workers to
    take unpaid leave rather than providing them with accommodations. In 2019, it came to light that at least seven
    workers had sued the company after they were denied accommodations and fired when they became pregnant. According to
    the report, their request 'included longer bathroom breaks and fewer continuous hours on their feet.' In every case,
    workers were fired after informing their managers they were pregnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, an Amazon worker suffered a miscarriage under harsh working conditions after her repeated requests for
    lighter work duty were denied. Pregnant workers at an Amazon warehouse required medical attention in 2011 as the
    result of extreme workplace temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bank of America has been outspoken in defending Roe as 'settled law' and is discussing implementing abortion related
    benefits. But they have been sued on multiple occasions for discriminating against pregnant employees, including one
    who was reportedly told by a branch manager to have an abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And mega-'woke' Microsoft made a big deal of announcing it will fund abortion travel expenses. However, the company
    has faced extensive allegations of discrimination against pregnant workers&nbsp;—&nbsp;including an instance where a
    manager claimed the company didn’t want to 'waste' a promotion on a worker in case she got pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A truly progressive company would implement policies to support working moms and families —retaining their skill and
    talent, not treat them as cogs and their children as an inconvenient liability. Yet such instances of deep hypocrisy
    go on and on, making it clear that too many woke corporate officials are looking out for their bottom line under the
    cover of 'women’s rights.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pro-life Americans should beware of the danger to countless unborn children and mothers posed by ESG policies. An
    estimated $35.3 trillion —&nbsp;more than a third of all assets in large markets — fall within ESG investments. With
    its under-the-radar corrosive power and malleable standards, ESG offers an ideal tool for the abortion lobby to
    manipulate and exploit, rather than appeal to hearts and minds they are losing at the ballot box, now that unelected
    Supreme Court justices won’t do their bidding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They won’t stop there. They will push for more and more companies to be effectively compelled to fund abortion on
    demand, even brutal and dangerous late-term abortions, in blue states where abortion is legal up to the moment of
    birth. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink candidly admitted coercive tactics: 'You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock
    we are forcing behaviors.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is hope: in June, Walmart shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposed audit of 'risks and costs to the
    company caused by enacted or proposed state policies severely restricting reproductive rights' (abortion). The more
    people are aware of how these funds are being abused to hijack our political process and put a target on babies and
    moms, the more we can band together to stop it.&nbsp;</p>
