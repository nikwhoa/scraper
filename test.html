<p>The XRP price has declined by 2% in the past 24 hours, falling to $0.386705 amid a marketwide selloff yesterday. Its
    current level means that it has fallen by 6% in a week but risen by 10% in the last 30 days, with potentially
    signaling further losses this weekend.</p>
<p>Today's movements also follow , possibly in order to sell the altcoin ahead of further falls. However, while the
    short-term looks unfavorable for XRP, the prospect of a Ripple win against the SEC raises hopes for a big rally
    later in the year.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Prediction as XRP Whale Activates Wallet With 30 Million Tokens – What’s Going On?</h2>
<p>XRP's chart suggests that further losses may come in the next few days before the altcoin's price settles and begins
    rising again. In particular, its relative strength index (purple) has shown a consistent decline in the past few
    days, and may continue dropping towards 30 before climbing upward again, along with XRP's price.</p>
<p>Something similar applies to XRP's 30-day moving average (red), which after reaching a peak relative to its 200-day
    average (blue) looks like it could begin falling down again.</p>
<p>The key support level to watch out for here is $0.38. If XRP falls decisively below this level, further pain could be
    ahead.</p>
<p>That this is a possibility has been underlined in the past couple of days by reports of whales moving XRP to
    exchanges. Indeed, one large investor transferred 34 million XRP (worth about $13.5 million) to Bitstamp a couple of
    days ago, and may have been a big part of the reason why the coin fell in the past day.</p>
<p>Still, it remains important to look at the bigger, longer-term picture here, with Ripple's case against the SEC still
    looking good for XRP and the wider cryptocurrency market. According to , this case is likely to conclude by the end
    of the first half of 2023, or by the end of the year at the very latest.</p>
<p>While the SEC has scored victories in similar cases in recent months, it's certainly not a foregone conclusion that
    it will win this particular case. To begin with, the end of last month saw Web3 platform LBRY against the SEC, with
    its appeal hearing resulting in a declaration from the judge that the third-party sale of LBC tokens does not count
    as the sale of unregistered securities.</p>
<p>This is highly significant for Ripple, since it suggests that if the court does find that Ripple itself sold
    unregistered securities, this judgment won't prevent exchanges from continuing to list XRP. As such, even a loss for
    Ripple may end up being kind of irrelevant to the future of Ripple and crypto.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the past months have brought a range of small victories for Ripple. This includes , as well as
    related to a 2018 speech given by then-Chairman William Hinman.</p>
<p>More generally, observers have also claimed that the SECr has been unable to establish how Ripple developed a 'common
    enterprise' -- as described in the Howey test -- that would boost the value of XRP. If accurate, such an analysis
    suggests that Ripple may end up securing some kind of positive judgment or settlement.</p>
<p>And what's promising for Ripple is that it has been able to grow its business even in the context of a long-running
    legal battle. For instance, its revealed last week that it made $226.31 million in net XRP sales in that quarter
    alone.</p>
<p>Given the health of Ripple's business, a win in its case with the SEC could really clear the way for a big expansion
    in demand for XRP. The altcoin's price could easily rise to $1 in a matter of days after the arrival of a positive
    conclusion, while the end of the year could see it rise even higher.</p>
