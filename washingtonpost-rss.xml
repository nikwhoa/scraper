A representative for Craig’s campaign declined to comment Wednesday, saying they would do so when a decision on their own case came down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In a &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/michigan-governor-fraudulent-signatures-craig-johnson/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8' target='_blank'&gt;May 23 report&lt;/a&gt;, the Michigan elections bureau found that five GOP candidates for the gubernatorial nomination were ineligible to appear on the primary ballot because they had submitted thousands of invalid signatures on their nominating petitions. State investigators identified 36 people who circulated petitions for their campaigns “who submitted fraudulent petition sheets consisting entirely of invalid signatures,” the bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Democrats &lt;a href='https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/james-craig-accused-gathering-fake-signatures-bid-make-michigan-ballot'&gt;criticized the findings&lt;/a&gt; as “proof … of a massive forgery scheme,” while the campaigns for Johnson and Craig cast themselves as victims of signature gatherers who had circulated their petitions fraudulently without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;For five of the 10 GOP candidates, the fraudulent petition sheets meant they fell below the threshold of 15,000 valid signatures required to appear on the ballot. Those deemed ineligible included Johnson, Craig, Markey, Donna Brandenburg and Michael Brown, who immediately withdrew from the governor’s race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Last Thursday, the Board of State Canvassers, composed of two Democrats and two Republicans, met to discuss the elections bureau’s report and deadlocked on a decision, resulting in the five candidates being disqualified for the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In a &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/brandenburg4mi/status/1531478283782594560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1531478283782594560%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc' target='_blank'&gt;Twitter post&lt;/a&gt;, Brandenburg said she had been “unlawfully removed” from the ballot and solicited donations for “help to fight this.” Johnson, Craig and Markey filed lawsuits with the appeals court afterward, arguing that all of the signatures on their petitions needed to be scrutinized individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In its decision in Johnson’s case Wednesday, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that the Board of State Canvassers did not have a “clear legal duty” to check every single signature against the qualified voter file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Likewise, because the Board had the discretion to not check each and every signature submitted by the fraudulent-petition circulators, the act Johnson is seeking to compel defendants to perform is not ministerial in nature,” the ruling stated. “Because Johnson bears the burden of demonstrating his entitlement to the requested writ … we conclude that his failure to show that the act requested is ministerial and his failure to show a clear legal duty on the part of the Board are fatal to his claim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Late Wednesday, the appeals court denied Markey’s motion to intervene “for the same essential reasons set forth in [Johnson’s] case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The disqualifications and legal challenges have upended the Republican primary race for Michigan governor two months before the August primary — and the reports of petition signature fraud come as former president Donald Trump relentlessly perpetuates the debunked, baseless claim that widespread voter fraud cost him reelection in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The five remaining GOP gubernatorial candidates include Tudor Dixon, Ryan Kelley, Ralph Rebandt, Kevin Rinke and Garrett Soldano. The family of former education secretary Betsy DeVos &lt;a href='https://www.michiganradio.org/politics-government/2022-05-24/devos-family-endorses-tudor-dixon-for-michigan-governor' target='_blank'&gt;endorsed Dixon&lt;/a&gt; last week. The Republican nominee will face Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who is seeking another term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Johnson has said he shares Trump’s “&lt;a href='https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/09/johnson-vows-hold-detroit-accountable-unbalanced-precincts/9442148002/'&gt;concern about election security&lt;/a&gt;” and attended a fundraiser with the former president for a fellow Republican at Mar-a-Lago in March. Craig has &lt;a href='https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/08/james-craig-says-hed-accept-trump-endorsement-doesnt-take-position-on-stolen-election-claims.html'&gt;sought to distance himself more&lt;/a&gt; from Trump’s voter-fraud claims but has said he would support a “&lt;a href='https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/12/republican-james-craig-signals-support-2020-election-audit/8425118002/'&gt;thorough audit&lt;/a&gt;” of the 2020 election results and would accept Trump’s endorsement if it were offered to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The elections bureau said it did not have reason to believe specific candidates or campaigns were aware that their petitions were being fraudulently circulated, but made its recommendations to disqualify five of them based on whether a candidate met the 15,000-signature threshold after invalid signatures were removed from their petitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;According to the elections bureau, Craig’s campaign submitted 11,113 invalid signatures and 10,192 “facially valid” ones, while Johnson’s campaign submitted 9,393 invalid signatures and 13,800 facially valid ones, leaving both below the required threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The bureau’s investigation also found that Brandenburg’s campaign submitted 11,144 invalid signatures and 6,634 facially valid ones; Brown’s campaign submitted 13,809 invalid signatures and 7,091 facially valid ones; and Markey’s campaign submitted 17,374 invalid signatures and 4,430 facially valid ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The elections bureau noted that this level of fraud — both in the number of invalid signatures submitted and the number of campaigns affected — was unprecedented. Some of the fraudulent petition sheets tended to show “no evidence of normal wear,” or showed evidence of having been “round-tabled,” a practice in which each person in a group takes turns signing one line of a petition in an attempt to make the signatures appear authentic, the bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alice Crites contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After all, the typical U.S. family spends $2,060 on average per year for home utility bills, according to the most recent estimate &lt;a href='https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-expert/breaking-down-the-typical-utility-bill' target='_blank'&gt;published by EnergyStar.gov&lt;/a&gt;. So Biden is promising big savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But it turns out the White House has been engaging in some inflation of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;If that $500 figure appears familiar, it’s because you heard something similar in the president’s &lt;a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/' target='_blank'&gt;State of the Union address&lt;/a&gt; on March 1. He said his American Rescue Plan would “cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combating climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;That figure was a reference to &lt;a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published in October by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Rhodium predicted that if Biden’s climate change policies were adopted, &lt;a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=23' target='_blank'&gt;by 2030&lt;/a&gt; “national average annual household energy costs” would be “roughly $500 lower than under current policy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;First of all, that’s eight years from now — not a lot of help with the current inflation problem, which was the frame of Biden’s op-ed. But the bigger problem is that “national average annual household energy costs” is not the same thing as household utility bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;a href='https://rhg.com/team/john-larsen/' target='_blank'&gt;John Larsen&lt;/a&gt;, a Rhodium partner and principal author of the report, said the estimate includes both home energy services and the cost of driving. The two elements are roughly equal in terms of energy costs of $4,163 — $2,126 for mobility and $2,037 for home energy. (Note that the home energy element is similar to the EnergyStar estimate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But most of the estimated savings, Larsen said, comes from the driving side of the equation. “Of the $495 in savings, $403 comes from mobility savings (spending less money on gasoline either because of more efficient cars or electric vehicles) and the remainder is home energy savings,” he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Indeed, the report &lt;a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=24' target='_blank'&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that, if the Biden climate plan were adopted, home electricity bills by 2030 would be between one dollar more and five dollars less than under current policy. That might pay for an extra ice cream cone over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Larsen noted that Biden, in the op-ed, referred to learning this number in a conversation with utility executives, so he did not appear to be referencing the Rhodium report. “I can say that our numbers represent savings across all household energy expenditures and not just those associated with utility bills,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But when we located &lt;a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-roundtable-with-ceos-of-electric-utilities-to-discuss-his-build-back-better-agenda/' target='_blank'&gt;the transcript&lt;/a&gt; of Biden’s conversation with utility executives on Feb. 9, we found no reference to $500 in utility savings. The figure was also not mentioned in &lt;a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/readout-of-the-presidents-meeting-with-utility-ceos-who-support-the-climate-and-clean-energy-investments-in-build-back-better/' target='_blank'&gt;the White House readout&lt;/a&gt; of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Somehow, as inflation became a hot political issue, the $500 figure that was cited in the State of the Union address appears to have morphed into a reference to utility bills. A May 10 &lt;a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/10/the-biden-harris-inflation-plan-lowering-costs-and-lowering-the-deficit/' target='_blank'&gt;White House release&lt;/a&gt; on the “Biden-Harris Inflation Plan,” for instance, called on Congress to pass clean-energy legislation that would “save families an estimated $500 per year on their utility bills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Indeed, when we asked the White House for the source of the number mentioned in the Biden op-ed, we received … a link to the Rhodium report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The president wrote in an opinion article on his inflation plan — presumably vetted by staff — that utility executives told him “my plan would reduce the average family’s annual utility bills by $500.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But he didn’t hear that from utility executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And the report he is citing is not about household utility-bill savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Most of the claimed savings comes from the reduced cost of driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And the estimate is for 2030 — when he would no longer be president, even if he served a second term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Is there any doubt the president earns Four Pinocchios?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;(&lt;a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35'&gt;About our rating scale&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Send us facts to check by filling out &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href='https://hosted-washpost.submissionplatform.com/sub/hosted/5c911f64439aa20034c4f0b7'&gt;&lt;b&gt;this form&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up for The Fact Checker &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href='http://wapo.st/1OGIZWF'&gt;&lt;b&gt;weekly newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Fact Checker is a verified &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/#code?itid=lk_inline_manual_38'&gt;&lt;b&gt;signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Biden says he heard late about baby formula shortage</title>
    <link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/01/biden-formula-heard-late/</link>
    <pubDate>2022-06-02T14:05:24.598Z</pubDate>

    <description>&lt;img srcset='undefined' /&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;President Biden said Wednesday that he did not become aware of the baby formula shortage until about two months after industry leaders knew they faced a major crisis, raising new questions about the administration’s monitoring and handling of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Biden’s comments came after he met with executives of companies that manufacture infant formula, who told the president they knew the shortage would be severe in February after the closure of an Abbott plant in Michigan. Biden suggested he was not informed until April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I don’t think anyone anticipated the impact of the shutdown of one facility,” Biden said after the meeting, adding, “Once we learned the extent of it and how broad it was, it kicked everything into gear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But when reporters noted that the executives had said they immediately recognized the scope of the problem, Biden said, “They did, but I didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The disconnect between the industry’s alertness to the looming crisis and the administration’s lack of awareness was hinted at during the panel discussion itself. Biden asked one panelist directly if his company had been surprised by the “profound effect immediately” of the Abbott closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“No, sir, we were aware of the general impact that this would have,” said Robert Cleveland, a senior vice president at Reckitt. “From the moment that that recall was announced, we reached out immediately to retail partners like Target and Walmart to tell them this is what we think will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;It was unclear from the discussion whether the responsibility lay primarily with the industry, for not alerting federal officials of the imminent shortage; or with federal agencies that monitor the industry for not sufficiently conveying the problems to the White House; or with the White House itself, for not reacting faster to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In recent weeks, Biden has scrambled to show he is on top of the matter. He invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up domestic production of baby formula, and his administration has &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/27/operation-fly-formula-australian-product/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14' target='_blank'&gt;airlifted supplies from foreign countries&lt;/a&gt; to try to address the mushrooming crisis. But the declaration by industry leaders that the scope of the problem was immediately clear to them in February raises questions of why the president was slow to learn of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did not offer more details on the timeline, but she said the administration launched a “whole-of-government approach” shortly after the Abbott plant shut down. The Food and Drug Administration closed the Abbott plant in February after a federal inspection found samples of a dangerous bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“We have been doing this whole-of-government approach since the recall,” she said at the White House daily press briefing after Biden met with the executives. “We have been working on this for months, for months. We have been taking this incredibly seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;When pressed why Biden himself said he was unaware of the “whole-of-government approach,” Jean-Pierre said that Biden “has multiple issues, crises at the moment” and that administration officials often respond to problems before the president is aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Seeing the empty shelves is unacceptable,” she said. “Seeing what families are going through is unacceptable. This is why we have been working 24-7 to make sure that we are using every lever at our disposal to deliver for the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Prior to Biden’s meeting, the White House announced its third and fourth round of formula shipments from overseas as part of its “Operation Fly Formula.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Officials said United Airlines had agreed to transport Kendamil formula for free from Heathrow Airport in London to multiple airports across the United States over a three-week period. The formula will be distributed and available for purchase at selected U.S. retailers nationwide as well as online, the White House said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;All told, about 3.7 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula will be delivered, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The White House also announced that two flights facilitated by the U.S. government would transport Bubs Australia infant formulas from Melbourne, Australia, to Pennsylvania and California on June 9 and June 11. That delivery will include about 4.6 million 8-ounce bottles, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Still, despite the all-hands-on-deck approach to replenishing the American supply, store shelves continue to be emptier: Data firm IRI reported Tuesday that the nationwide in-stock inventory figure was 76 percent for the week ending May 22, down from 79 percent the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Wagner and Laura Reiley contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And for good reason. Donald Trump has made &lt;a href='https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/16/politics/trump-secretary-of-state-big-lie/index.html' target='_blank'&gt;a concerted effort to install loyalists and election deniers as secretaries of state&lt;/a&gt; and in other high-ranking positions with election responsibilities in key states. And the overall tenor of such GOP primaries nationwide has &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/07/gop-candidates-election-claims/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2' target='_blank'&gt;trended decidedly toward Trump’s baseless allegations of a “stolen election”&lt;/a&gt; — despite the lessons of Jan. 6, 2021. When people who say they wouldn’t have certified President Biden’s 2020 win might be in a position to stop that come 2024, that matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But it’s worth emphasizing and reemphasizing just how much these battles could truly be forged at the lowest levels of government — involving people and positions you’ve probably never heard of. These are the positions Republicans have long proved superior at mobilizing their side to focus on. And a new Politico report reinforces how an effort to sway future elections could spring from those positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;As &lt;a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/01/gop-contest-elections-tapes-00035758' target='_blank'&gt;Heidi Przybyla writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class='blockquote border-box black font--article-body pl-sm pl-md-ns bc-black b bl cb mb-md mt-sm-ns mb-lg-mod-ns'&gt;&lt;div class='' data-qa='article-quote'&gt;Video recordings of Republican Party operatives meeting with grass roots activists provide an inside look at a multipronged strategy to target and potentially overturn votes in Democratic precincts: Install trained recruits as regular poll workers and put them in direct contact with party attorneys.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'&gt;The plan, as outlined by a Republican National Committee staffer in Michigan, includes utilizing rules designed to provide political balance among poll workers to install party-trained volunteers prepared to challenge voters at Democratic-majority polling places, developing a website to connect those workers to local lawyers and establishing a network of party-friendly district attorneys who could intervene to block vote counts at certain precincts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'&gt;“Being a poll worker, you just have so many more rights and things you can do to stop something than [as] a poll challenger,” said Matthew Seifried, the RNC’s election integrity director for Michigan, stressing the importance of obtaining official designations as poll workers in a meeting with GOP activists in Wayne County last Nov. 6. It is one of a series of recordings of GOP meetings between summer of 2021 and May of this year obtained by POLITICO.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'&gt;Backing up those front-line workers, “it’s going to be an army,” Seifried promised at an Oct. 5 training session. “We’re going to have more lawyers than we’ve ever recruited, because let’s be honest, that’s where it’s going to be fought, right?”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Indeed, that &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;where it’s largely going to be fought, at least initially. And the fact that it’s being preemptively pitched as a war tells you what kind of people might be drawn into taking part, especially in a party in which a majority wrongly believe the 2020 election was illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;You need only look to 2020 for proof of the importance of these lower-profile positions, particularly in Michigan. It was the GOP canvassers in Detroit-based Wayne County who &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/wayne-county-election/2020/11/18/b515fa14-29c9-11eb-92b7-6ef17b3fe3b4_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_10' target='_blank'&gt;momentarily declined to certify the results there&lt;/a&gt;. It was poll workers and challengers whose claims and affidavits — often quickly debunked — became the basis for far-fetched legal challenges seeking to throw out votes. (One of them &lt;a href='https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/06/michigan-republican-secretary-state-picks-false-election-claims/9661591002/' target='_blank'&gt;was Kristina Karamo&lt;/a&gt;, who has  parlayed that to become the GOP-backed candidate for Michigan secretary of state). It was a &lt;a href='https://www.record-eagle.com/news/disinformation-agents-were-watching-and-waiting-to-exploit-an-error-like-antrim-countys/article_404c0e4e-2695-11eb-8517-8fa00b7f3aa1.html' target='_blank'&gt;clerk in Antrim County&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/24/most-brutal-debunking-trumps-fraud-claims-yet-republicans/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10' target='_blank'&gt;GOP state senator&lt;/a&gt; who rejected claims that an easily explained error there was some kind of a canary in a voter-fraud coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Around the country, it was officials like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) standing in the way of these efforts — but it was also lower-profile officials like &lt;a href='https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/20/maricopa-county-supervisors-meet-consider-certifying-election-results/6362991002/' target='_blank'&gt;GOP supervisors in Maricopa County, Ariz.&lt;/a&gt;, and a statewide Republican canvasser in Michigan, Aaron Van Langevelde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Since then, there has been a concerted effort to remove them and the roadblocks they posed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Several Michigan canvassers who certified Biden’s win — Van Langevelde and also others at the county level — &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-allies-election-oversight/2021/11/28/3933b3ce-4227-11ec-9ea7-3eb2406a2e24_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_5&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_15' target='_blank'&gt;are now out&lt;/a&gt;. The deniers are being elevated, while those who stand by the election results have repeatedly been censured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Just as important, laws are being changed, despite no evidence calling the 2020 election results into question. As &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/14/how-republicans-seek-make-it-easier-challenge-even-overturn-election-results/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'&gt;we wrote late last year&lt;/a&gt;, not only are secretaries of state being targeted for defeat by Trump allies, but two (Raffensperger and Katie Hobbs in Arizona) have been &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/27/gops-brazen-move-strip-power-fraud-narrative-busting-secretary-state-again/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'&gt;stripped of election-related power&lt;/a&gt;. Wisconsin Republicans are trying to &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/27/trumps-gop-election-purge-marches-despite-setbacks-georgia/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'&gt;get rid of a bipartisan election commission&lt;/a&gt; and put the process under more partisan control (and recently succeeded in pushing a critic of Trump’s fraud claims to resign). They’ve &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-national-divide/2021/09/05/24165092-0b4e-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_41&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'&gt;increased the penalties&lt;/a&gt; for supposed wrongdoing by election administrators. A report last week from a watchdog showed &lt;a href='https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DCITM_2022.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;14 states had passed laws &lt;/a&gt;that would make it easier to challenge elections in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;It’s possible to oversell the true danger of any of this. Some doubt, for instance, the impact that canvassers can have when it comes to not certifying a vote — given that such canvassers’ jobs are generally ministerial. Even poll workers who raise a fuss about mundane vote-counting issues could see their efforts rebuffed by the courts when push comes to shove, as they were in 2020. It’s possible the 2024 election won’t be close enough for any of this to matter, and that the fever in the GOP surrounding voter fraud could break if, for instance, Trump fades politically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But one of the lessons of 2020 is that the few Republicans who clearly rebuked Trump’s claim were, not coincidentally, disproportionately those who were &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/08/gop-officials-overwhelmingly-side-against-trumps-voter-fraud-claims-when-forced-decide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'&gt;forced to actually take a position by virtue of their official duties&lt;/a&gt;. Such people have since been weeded out, often through targeting in GOP primaries, but also through attrition (such as election workers &lt;a href='https://apnews.com/article/election-officials-retire-trump-2020-threats-misinformation-3b810d8b3b3adee2ca409689788b863f' target='_blank'&gt;heading for the exits because of threats&lt;/a&gt;); in several cases Republicans have warmed to voter-fraud claims they &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/07/gop-candidates-election-claims/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'&gt;never endorsed back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The pressure has been palpable, and it’s manifested itself in a number of ways that matter, irrespective of &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/georgia-texas-primaries-takeaways/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'&gt;Raffensperger somehow managing to win renomination&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The problem with telling that story — of how democracy could be undermined at the grass roots — is that it’s very difficult to get a handle on it in any truly authoritative and quantitative way; it depends so much on the views of people whose views have never been recorded, because nobody outside of a select few even know who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But there is little doubt about what kinds of people will be drawn to these lower-level positions, because we’re seeing what kinds of people are being drawn into running for similar, higher-profile roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And the problem could go beyond poll workers raising legally valid complaints or canvassers and secretaries of state refusing to certify results. As we saw in 2020, the simple presence of enough smoke and misinformation was enough to get state and congressional Republicans to seriously consider overriding the vote totals in certain states. The effort to get GOP-run state legislatures to send alternate slates of electors and Congress to reject the results on Jan. 6 was haphazard and didn’t pan out, but we’re in a very different environment even than we were then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And if enough election truthers are in place to color the process from the grass-roots level up — in a way they failed to in 2020 when the groundwork wasn’t yet laid — it’s not so difficult to see Republicans justifying decisions to themselves that they didn’t in 2020. Because if there’s one thing the Trump era has reinforced, it’s that these things often flow up from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On Thursday, congressional staffers will question Ennis’s deputies about the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Given the gravity of the allegations, I strongly encourage the Integrity Committee to work expeditiously,” Jason Miller, deputy director for management for the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a letter sent late Monday that also noted concerns about reports of retaliation against whistleblowers who questioned the penalties. “It is critical that the American public have full confidence in the important work of the Inspector General community, and that is why it is imperative these allegations be resolved in an appropriate and expeditious manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Rebecca Rose, a spokeswoman for Ennis, wrote in an email, “We will continue to be responsive and cooperate fully” with the investigation and a parallel probe of the penalties by acting Social Security Commissioner Kilolo Kijakazi, who has &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/21/full-investigation-pledged-vast-fines-imposed-by-social-security/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10'&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;a “full investigation” of Ennis’s oversight of the anti-fraud program. Ennis, as a member of the inspectors general council’s Integrity Committee, must recuse herself from all committee matters while the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Lerner declined to comment on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;At the heart of the investigation is the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Civil Monetary Penalty Program, a little-known anti-fraud program run by the inspector general’s office. During the Trump administration, under Ennis’s watch, the program began levying unprecedented fines, which reached hundreds of thousands of dollars, on more than 100 people accused of improperly receiving disability benefits. The fines were imposed without considering the age, financial condition or other mitigating factors of the recipients — a departure from how the program had previously operated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Many of those fined had no hope of ever being able to pay. Over a seven-month period that ended in mid-2019, 83 people were charged a total of $11.5 million, documents obtained by The Post showed — a jump from less than $700,000 for all of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Civil fines are supposed to provide an alternative when fraud is considered too insignificant to warrant criminal prosecution by the Justice Department. In years past, cases had often settled, with agreements for drastically lower fines as claimants gradually paid back what they owed taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;On Thursday, the staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform and Ways and Means committees will summon two of Ennis’s deputies to brief them on how the fines escalated, and about the treatment of two senior officials on Ennis’s staff who raised repeated concerns about the penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Those senior officials were then abruptly placed on administrative leave, with one fired and the other demoted. Both are back at work, one after settling a whistleblower case with the agency. The other, attorney Deborah Shaw, in May was found by an administrative law judge at the Merit Systems Protection Board to have been the victim of “whistleblower reprisal” by Ennis’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The Office of Special Counsel, a small independent agency that investigates complaints of retaliation against whistleblowers who report waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, also has opened a case after receiving multiple complaints that employees who work for Ennis have suffered reprisals, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. A spokesman for Special Counsel Henry Kerner declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Ennis’s chief counsel on Wednesday told the attorneys who work in the civil penalty program to stop issuing fines until further notice while Kijakazi’s staff conducts a thorough review of the program, which was delegated to the inspector general’s office when it started in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Top House Democrats welcomed the new investigation by CIGIE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“It’s a welcome first step in understanding who has been harmed by the apparent abuses by Social Security’s Office of the Inspector General, and to what extent,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;Mass.) said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who leads the government operations panel on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in a statement that “inspectors general must be pure as driven snow” and said other watchdogs have lingered in their positions for years while the council investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;i&gt;“&lt;/i&gt;Congress is watching, and our oversight Subcommittee is prepared to take appropriate, swift action,” Connolly wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The investigation is likely to be far-reaching. The troubled anti&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;fraud program is one of several controversies roiling Social Security’s 500-person internal watchdog division, charged with oversight of the agency that distributes retirement benefits to 69 million Americans and monthly disability checks to about 15 million others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Dozens of senior auditors, law enforcement agents and other staff have quit or retired, many in frustration with what they describe as Ennis’s mercurial leadership and lack of focus on the office’s mission, according to current and former staff members. Ennis has defended her leadership and said some employees bristle at changes when a new leader comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Audits have also plummeted. So has morale, which has taken a nosedive in successive surveys of the federal workforce since Ennis took over. New data for 2021 collected by the Office of Personnel Management for the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) and released internally Tuesday shows 28 percent of those who responded consider the inspector general’s office a good place to work, with 13 percent agreeing that their senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment. And 22 percent said senior leaders maintained high standards of honesty and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Rose, a spokeswoman for Ennis, called the inspector general’s staff “our most valuable resource in accomplishing our mission” and said the office has made efforts to “improve workplace engagement” for several years. “We are analyzing the 2021 FEVS survey results,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wade&lt;/i&gt; decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;If the justices roll back the fundamental right to abortion established nearly 50 years ago, the legal battle over reproductive rights will shift to state courts. Florida and 10 other states have already recognized and protected abortion access independently from the U.S. Supreme Court, through state constitutions and past state court decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The case filed Wednesday in Leon County will test the strength of the state’s protections embedded in the constitution and a decades-old state Supreme Court decision at a time when Florida’s highest court has become more conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“The Florida Supreme Court has long held that their state constitution protects the right to end a pregnancy. That means even if &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt; falls, abortion should remain protected in Florida, and this ban should be blocked,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the &lt;a href='https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/complaint_concerning_constitutional_challenge_to_statute_or_ordinance.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;groups behind the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes the ACLU of Florida and Planned Parenthood on behalf of health centers in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Like Florida, courts in Alaska, Minnesota and Montana have also issued rulings emphasizing that the government may not intrude into certain private decisions, including whether to terminate a pregnancy, according to a &lt;a href='https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/State-Constitutions-Report-4.19.22.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;report by the Center for Reproductive Rights&lt;/a&gt;. In Kansas, the state’s highest court has held that “natural rights” protect “personal autonomy,” including the right to abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;For more than three decades in Florida, courts have interpreted a voter-backed privacy provision of the state constitution to include the right to abortion. The state Supreme Court in 1989 invalidated a law requiring minors to obtain parental consent to get an abortion based on the provision that states that every “person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into his private life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The court’s ruling stated that it could “conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning one’s body that one can make in the course of a lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Florida has some of the least restrictive abortion laws in the southeast. The state  has allowed&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;abortion up to 24 weeks, the standard established by &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;, which protects access until a fetus is viable outside the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The 15-week ban — passed by the Republican-controlled legislature in March and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in April — is modeled on the Mississippi law under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Florida law includes exceptions to save the life of the mother and for “fatal fetal abnormalities” but not for rape or incest. Clinics and health-care providers could face criminal penalties&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and disciplinary action for performing abortions after the 15-week mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;State Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, said the new law is at odds with the “Florida value around privacy, around personal medical decisions, including someone’s pregnancy. There’s an understanding that it is not a politician’s place to get involved,” said Eskamani, who began her career as an abortion rights advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Despite Florida’s constitutional protections, the legal landscape in the state has changed as DeSantis has appointed new, more-conservative judges. In April, a lower court judge upheld the constitutionality of a 2015 law that requires a woman to wait 24 hours after consulting with a doctor before having an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I don’t think we can be naive about this,” Eskamani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In their filing Wednesday, lawyers for Florida abortion providers and abortion rights advocates urged the circuit court for Leon County to issue an injunction to prevent the 15-week ban from taking effect July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Despite Florida’s history of protecting the right to abortion, the Florida legislature recently engaged in a brazen attempt to override the will of the Florida people,” the attorneys wrote in the 33-page filing. The legislature, they said, passed a law that will “unlawfully intrude upon the fundamental privacy rights of Florida women. It will deny Floridians’ autonomy over their own bodies and undermine their ability to make deeply personal decisions about their lives, families, and health care free of government interference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In a statement Wednesday, the governor’s office said DeSantis is “confident that this law will ultimately withstand all legal challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an antiabortion organization, characterizes to the state’s abortion protections as an “artificial superpowered abortion right,” more expansive than the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court in &lt;i&gt;Roe &lt;/i&gt;and subsequent decisions. If the constitutional challenge filed Wednesday makes its way to the state Supreme Court, he said the newly configured, seven-member court is likely to reexamine past decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;State supreme courts “have the unique privilege of looking at the constitution with fresh eyes,” said Stemberger, who served on the judicial nominating commission for former Republican governor Jeb Bush. Florida’s high court, he added, “has already shown in the past year in multiple cases, its willingness to do this and to say, ‘The previous Supreme Court got it wrong.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;At the U.S. Supreme Court in December, the conservative majority at oral argument appeared likely to uphold Mississippi’s 15-week ban. A &lt;a href='https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-874f-dd36-a38c-c74f98520000' target='_blank'&gt;draft majority opinion made public last month by Politico&lt;/a&gt; showed that five justices had tentatively voted to overturn the right to abortion established in &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;. A final decision is expected before the term ends in late June or early July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The outcome of the Mississippi case and the state case filed Wednesday will influence future legislative efforts in Florida to restrict abortion access, said state Sen. Kelli Stargel, the lead sponsor of the 15-week ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“If all abortion decisions go back to the states, I would hate for our state to be seen as a place to have more opportunity for abortions than others,” said Stargel, a Republican from central Florida now running for an open congressional seat. “That’s disturbing to me. We are a pro-life state and we want to protect the unborn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caroline Kitchener contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

More than enough to make a guy cranky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But this is not just any guy. It’s Gregg Phillips, the guy who, in D’Souza’s film and at hearings in front of friendly state legislatures, has used intentionally pejorative language to cast his perceived opponents as criminals or dangerous. The people carrying ballots — which, if it occurred, wasn’t even illegal in two of the states True the Vote and D’Souza looked at — are “mules,” as in drug mules. The places where they allegedly collected these ballots (a part of the process left completely unproven in the film) become “stash houses.” All of it, he has declared, showed “organized crime.” It’s not subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;During a hearing before legislators in Arizona on Tuesday, Phillips applied that same tactic to members of the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I think somebody wrote — the New York Times or someone — wrote, well, you can tell that they’re walking down the street, but you can’t see which side of the street they’re on,” he said. “Utter nonsense. It’s complete nonsense. They’re asking the wrong questions. They’re asking the wrong people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“These articles are being written by journalistic terrorists,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Repeat that last line?” a legislator asked — drawing it out for emphasis, as she later made clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Yeah,” Phillips said. “The articles are being written by journalistic terrorists, of which I think are probably one or two in this room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Kelli Ward, chair of the Republican Party in the state, liked that phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-oembed-type='twitter' class='' style='min-height:171px'&gt;&lt;blockquote class='twitter-tweet'&gt;&lt;p lang='en' dir='ltr'&gt;False Information being written and disseminated by “journalistic terrorists” like some of these👇🏼👇🏼 &lt;a href='https://t.co/qTUxmfqQJc'&gt;pic.twitter.com/qTUxmfqQJc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Kelli Ward 🇺🇸 (@kelliwardaz) &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/kelliwardaz/status/1531778377605976064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'&gt;May 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async='' src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In addition to retweeting Ward, the state party went further, &lt;a href='https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/media/2022/05/31/arizona-republican-party-media-are-domestic-terrorists-tweet/7463139001/' target='_blank'&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt; that the “mainstream media is Domestic Terrorists.” It later deleted that and another similar tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;What’s remarkable about Phillips’s comment isn’t simply how astonishingly over-the-top it was, or even how it made obvious his predilection for exaggerating nefariousness. What’s remarkable is that the new presentation did little to nothing to actually address the valid questions about his purported research. In fact, he made a comment that significantly &lt;i&gt;weakened&lt;/i&gt; his case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;At issue is the reliability of his analysis of data collected from cellphones. The idea that thousands of people were ferrying ballots around battleground states depends on the regularity of those phones being in proximity to places with ballot drop boxes. Phillips and his supporters have regularly tried to suggest that people who doubt his analysis are casting doubt on the ability of phones to precisely geolocate someone, which is not the case. But it is the case that there’s good reason to think that Phillips’s analyses don’t include precise measurements of proximity to ballot drop boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Consider what actually determining that someone visited a drop box would require. You’d need a precise measurement of location from the phone and you’d need to know precisely where the drop box was. In other words, you’d need to know that the phone was within a foot or two of a space that itself is only a few square feet. Not only will experts tell you that most cellphone geolocation data is not sufficiently precise, there’s no indication that the True the Vote people even knew where drop boxes were located at the libraries and government offices that hosted them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The best indication we have of what True the Vote was looking at comes from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which in September &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1451309892824936452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1451309892824936452%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpb.org%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2Fgbi-says-gops-cellphone-data-lacks-enough-evidence-prove-ballot-harvesting' target='_blank'&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that the data it was provided was insufficient to launch an investigation. The GBI said that the data was “cell site location information” — a triangulated location estimate less accurate than GPS — and that it centered on identifying visits “within 100 feet of a voter drop box.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;That’s significantly less precise than Phillips likes to suggest. During his testimony in Arizona, in fact, Phillips insisted that the military could get GPS precision down to a few centimeters. And &lt;a href='https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/#difference' target='_blank'&gt;that’s true&lt;/a&gt; — using specific technology that’s not generally available commercially. Using technology that there’s no reason to think he had. Instead, he insisted that by overlapping different bits of data — WiFi access and Bluetooth — he could get more precise. That’s not what the GBI says it received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;At one point, True the Vote’s team showed this map, purporting to show one person’s movements in Yuma County, Ariz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“This is a sample pattern of life for one device in Yuma County from October 7th through November 3rd,” Phillips’s colleague Catherine Engelbrecht said. “This device went to 77 unique drop boxes. And you can see in the lower right where those locations were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Beyond all of the other questions that naturally arise — like, why bother going to different drop boxes, particularly in less-populated areas? — the data appear to show cellphone pings of someone who lives in Yuma (at top center) and occasionally drives around the region. Do those blue dots correspond to clear visits to libraries? Or more accurately, to visits to drop boxes at those libraries? Not to mention that Yuma County’s 2020 voter guide doesn’t include locations like the Foothills Library (at 13226 S. Frontage Rd. in Yuma) on its &lt;a href='https://www.yumacountyaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=41773' target='_blank'&gt;list of drop-off locations&lt;/a&gt;. We’re just meant to take Phillips’s and Engelbrecht’s word for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;That’s what D’Souza did. I &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/discussing-gaps-2000-mules-with-dinesh-dsouza/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'&gt;spoke to him&lt;/a&gt; about the movie and about Phillips’s data, repeatedly pressing him on questions about credibility. I asked him, for example, how he could be confident that people shown in the movie dropping off ballots were actually “mules,” given that there was no evidence provided for their having gone to more than one drop box. Considering one example of a guy on a bike dropping off a ballot, I pointed out to D’Souza that, beyond Phillips suggesting that the guy was being paid to deposit the ballot, the movie makes no direct claim and offers no evidence that he’s a “mule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Of course there is a claim being made!” D’Souza insisted. “The context of the movie is to explain that that’s the search criterion. All the mules being counted under that rubric went to 10 or more drop boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Fine. But in Arizona, Phillips made a different claim — to again disparage journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“One of the fallacies in people evaluating and fact-checking the movie,” he said, “really centered around a couple of videos that were out there of people shoving a whole bunch of ballots in.” That would presumably include the guy on the bike, who Phillips claimed (though it’s not apparent in the video) pulls “ballots” out of his backpack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Interestingly, only one of those people actually was a mule,” he continued, “because they didn’t meet the standard of having to get inside 10 times and go to one of the [nonprofit organizations] five times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;You got that? Fact checks &lt;a href='https://www.ajc.com/politics/what-2000-mules-leaves-out-from-ballot-harvesting-claims/FFMNUU56RVBRNOLZKWHUREQPEU/' target='_blank'&gt;pointing out&lt;/a&gt; that the people included in the film “2000 Mules” were not actually mules were flawed because only one of the people shown in the film actually met Phillips’s “mule” standard anyway. (An email to Phillips asking him to identify which person was the mule did not receive a response by the time of publication though he later wrote to say the quote was “out of context.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The person shown in the movie before the guy on the bike, incidentally, was a woman who Engelbrecht claimed had visited “dozens and dozens” of drop boxes in both the 2020 presidential election and the Georgia Senate runoff in January 2021. So is she the sole mule? Or was Engelbrecht offering &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/even-geolocation-maps-2000-mules-are-misleading/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45' target='_blank'&gt;another misrepresentation&lt;/a&gt; to viewers? And if so, did D’Souza know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;It’s because of things like this that reporters urge caution in viewing the movie or in taking Phillips’s claims at face value. And it’s because we urge caution that Phillips compares us to people who use violence to evoke fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Gun violence doesn’t usually look like Uvalde</title>

It was also an outlier event in America’s enormous annual toll of gun violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;To be very clear: What happened in Uvalde was horrifying and demands some effort at preventing similar attacks. But, in part thanks to the enormous amount of attention such attacks receive, it also risks presenting gun deaths in the United States as something other than a grinding, macabre norm that usually escapes the public eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Data from the &lt;a href='https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html' target='_blank'&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; shows that, in 2019 and 2020, an average of about 3,500 people per month died of gun violence. The toll was higher in 2020, the first year of the &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7' target='_blank' class='contextual_link'&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; pandemic. That year was &lt;a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/' target='_blank'&gt;the deadliest for gun violence&lt;/a&gt; on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;While the increase in 2020 was a function of an increase in homicides and accidental shootings, it was still the case that about half of the recorded deaths were suicides. In 2019, about 61 percent of gun-related deaths were suicides. In 2020, about 54 percent were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Notice that we’ve also included the death toll from recorded mass-shooting incidents, using the standard from &lt;a href='https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/' target='_blank'&gt;the Gun Violence Archive&lt;/a&gt;. Only a small percentage of deaths in a given month were a function of incidents in which four or more people were shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;This isn’t good news. That thousands of people are fatally shot a year in separate incidents is a reflection of how widespread gun violence is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;That the shooter in Uvalde used a rifle is also not the norm. There are a few ways to categorize weapon ownership in the country, none perfect. If we look at &lt;a href='https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_year_by_state_type.pdf/view' target='_blank'&gt;FBI background checks&lt;/a&gt; for new permits or sales (transfers) from licensed dealers in 2020 and 2021, we see that most are for handguns. There were spikes in March 2020 (at the outset of the pandemic) and June of that year (as protests erupted across the country). But in no month during those two years were most checks not for handguns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;As you might expect, given that bit of data, most of the firearms manufactured in the United States in 2020 &lt;a href='https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/afmer-2020-final-report-cover-sheet/download' target='_blank'&gt;were handguns&lt;/a&gt; — nearly 60 percent of the 11 million firearms produced in this country. When it comes to firearms used in crimes, handguns are far more common. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives &lt;a href='https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2020' target='_blank'&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 80 percent of the 393,000 guns it recovered from crime scenes and traced were pistols or revolvers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;A medical analogy is apt. Incidents like Uvalde are terrifying, acute manifestations of America’s unique gun culture. But the chronic problem is daily death at a smaller scale from people killing themselves or others, often by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Ending incidents like the one in Uvalde is obviously important. But there would still be more than 100 gun deaths a day on average in the United States, most of them people taking their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was used to kill hopes for freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The camera pans to reveal a noose around Booker’s neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“It was used to kill my ancestors,” he says. “Now, in a historic victory for our commonwealth, I have become the first Black Kentuckian to receive the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-oembed-type='youtube' class='' style='min-height:0'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“My opponent?” Booker continues, as images of Paul flash on the screen. “The person who single-handedly blocked an anti-lynching act from being federal law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The ad does not mention that Paul supported an updated bill, known as the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, that passed in the Senate in March and is now law. Paul did single-handedly hold up the legislation in 2020, saying he was concerned it could be applied too broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In March, Paul &lt;a href='https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/rand-paul/2022/03/01/rand-paul-backs-new-emmett-till-act-after-holding-up-old-one/9319204002/' target='_blank'&gt;acknowledged to the Louisville Courier-Journal&lt;/a&gt; that “it wasn’t a popular stand to slow this bill down” in 2020 but that he still thought it had been the right thing to do. Paul later co-sponsored the updated bill, which was introduced by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“In the end, I think the compromise language will hopefully keep us from incarcerating somebody for some kind of crime that’s not lynching,” Paul told the newspaper. “We just wanted to make sure that the punishment was proportional to the crime, and I guess it’s just good news that it finally worked out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In a statement Wednesday, Jake Cox, Paul’s deputy campaign manager, suggested Booker’s ad was “a desperate misrepresentation of the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;'Dr. Paul worked diligently with Senators Booker and Scott to strengthen the language of this legislation and is a cosponsor of the bill that now ensures that federal law will define lynching as the absolutely heinous crime that it is,” Cox said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;President Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law in March, noting that it had taken more than a century of failed efforts to pass a federal law that expressly prohibited lynching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“For a long time, lynching was pure terror to enforce the lie that not everyone, not everyone belongs in America, not everyone is created equal,” Biden said then in a Rose Garden ceremony after the bill’s signing. “Innocent men, women and children hung by nooses from trees, bodies burned and drowned and castrated. Their crimes? Trying to vote, trying to go to school, trying to own a business or preach the gospel. False accusations of murder, arson and robbery. Simply being Black.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The new law amends the U.S. Code to designate lynching a hate crime punishable by as many as 30 years in prison. More than &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/10/22/more-than-people-have-been-lynched-us-trump-isnt-one-them/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_12&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_5&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_22'&gt;4,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, mostly African Americans, were reported lynched in the United States from 1882 to 1968 in all but a handful of states. Ninety-nine percent of perpetrators escaped state or local punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Booker and Paul will face off in the November general election. Paul faced four challengers in the May 17 Republican primary but won handily. Booker, a former Kentucky state representative and Louisville native, was unsuccessful in his attempt to be the Democratic Senate nominee in 2020 but also easily won his primary race last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Booker’s new ad also calls out Paul for once &lt;a href='https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/may/27/sarah-silverman/did-rand-paul-equate-right-health-care-slavery/' target='_blank'&gt;comparing expanded health care to slavery&lt;/a&gt; and for his &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/rand-pauls-rewriting-of-his-own-remarks-on-the-civil-rights-act/2013/04/10/5b8d91c4-a235-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_blog.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_24' target='_blank'&gt;past criticisms of the Civil Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Felicia Sonmez and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I announced my intent to attend the academy, full of righteousness as only a 16-year-old can be. And like all good parents, they said, ‘Oh, she’ll outgrow it,' ” Fagan said, drawing laughter from the crowd of about 1,800 uniformed Coast Guard members and guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I did not,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Fagan, 58, succeeds Adm. Karl L. Schultz, who is retiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Fagan was previously vice commandant, a role she assumed last summer. Her &lt;a href='https://www.uscg.mil/Biographies/Display/Article/1391225/admiral-linda-l-fagan/' target='_blank'&gt;decades of Coast Guard service&lt;/a&gt; include a tour on the heavy icebreaker Polar Star — the only woman aboard the ship — as well as assignments on every continent. She is also the Coast Guard’s first Gold Ancient Trident, which means she is the officer with the longest service record in the marine safety field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In her remarks Wednesday, Fagan gave a symbolic nod to &lt;a href='https://www.history.uscg.mil/Browse-by-Topic/Notable-People/All/Article/1762753/admiral-owen-w-siler/' target='_blank'&gt;Adm. Owen W. Siler&lt;/a&gt;, the former Coast Guard commandant who played a key role in integrating women into the service beginning in the 1970s.

He noted Wednesday that Fagan joined the Coast Guard &lt;a href='https://www.history.uscg.mil/Browse-by-Topic/Notable-People/Women/Women-in-Coast-Guard-Historical-Chronology/' target='_blank'&gt;only five years after the first women graduated from the academy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Women comprised 8 percent of Fagan’s Coast Guard Academy graduating class in 1985, Biden said. By contrast, about 40 percent of the academy’s cadets today are women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“We need to ensure women have an opportunity to succeed and thrive throughout their professional careers, and that means providing support and resources so women can compete fairly and fully for promotions and make sure women are not penalized in their career for having children,” Biden said.&lt;i&gt; “&lt;/i&gt;It also means creating an environment where every member of the armed forces feels safe in the ranks — including from sexual assault and harassment — where their contributions are respected&lt;i&gt;.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;During &lt;a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnCVB9WvZQQ' target='_blank'&gt;an event last year&lt;/a&gt; for a local chapter of the Coast Guard’s Women’s Leadership Initiative, Fagan appeared with her daughter, Lt.

I think we all want to be able to look up and down the chain, across positions, and see people who look like us or who think like us and be able to see that representation and know that we can do it, too.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hinckley Jr.&lt;/a&gt; will be unconditionally released June 15, ending one of the nation’s most notorious criminal cases 41 years after he shot Ronald Reagan and three others outside a D.C. hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;At a final court hearing Wednesday in D.C., federal prosecutors and a defense lawyer for Hinckley agreed that he had successfully completed a nine-month observation period that U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman had required in September in issuing a written release order that takes effect this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“John Hinckley tried to kill the president of the United States. He came very close to doing so,” Friedman said Wednesday. But “without losing sight of what he did 40 years ago, he has been the most scrutinized person [in America’s mental health system] … living under a microscope as none of us have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I am confident Mr. Hinckley will do well in the years remaining to him,” Friedman said, adding that Hinckley had proved after four decades of supervision that he “should be ready to get on with his life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The Justice Department earlier had agreed to end court and medical supervision of Hinckley, &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/would-be-reagan-assassin-john-w-hinckley-jr-to-be-freed-after-35-years/2016/07/27/04142084-5015-11e6-a422-83ab49ed5e6a_story.html?utm_term=.f49cef32ad67&amp;itid=lk_readmore_manual_19&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_9'&gt;who was freed from a government psychiatric hospital to live with his mother in Williamsburg, Va., in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Hinckley, who turned 67 on Sunday, remains mentally stable and in compliance with his release and treatment conditions, according to his D.C. Department of Behavioral Health and private treatment team, which began recommending his full release in August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“The Government has found no evidence to suggest that Mr. Hinckley’s unconditional release should not be granted,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kacie M. Weston wrote to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;During the hearing Wednesday, Weston said the government had no objections to Hinckley’s release taking effect on June 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Hinckley was 25 when he shot Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady and two others with six exploding “Devastator” bullets from a .22-caliber pistol on March 30, 1981. A federal jury found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982, finding that he acted out of a deranged obsession to impress the actress Jodie Foster, setting off a historic debate that narrowed the insanity defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Over the years, Hinckley responded to treatment, winning court approval in 2000 for staff-supervised trips in Washington with family members. Under close supervision, his outings were gradually expanded to allow several nights and then two weeks a month, before Friedman allowed Hinckley to leave Washington’s St. Elizabeths Hospital in 2016 under a host of medical, travel and other conditions, the remaining requirements of which will be lifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;While on “convalescent leave” in recent years, for example, Hinckley has been ordered to stay away from D.C., people protected by the U.S. Secret Service, his victims and the news media. His access to social media and the Internet were restricted and subject to inspection, although Hinckley, who plays the guitar and paints, was allowed in 2020 to release writings, artwork and music under his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Hinckley was not in court Wednesday, but his longtime attorney, Barry Wm. Levine, said his doctors confirmed that his client does not and will not pose “a danger to himself or to others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Hinckley’s return to society “shows the fairness with which the system of justice should be administered,” Levine said. “There’s been no spin involved here. … The court has proceeded at a very cautious pace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Levine restated Hinckley’s &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/john-hinckley-unconditional-release/2021/09/27/8e5f5286-1f9f-11ec-9309-b743b79abc59_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_24' target='_blank'&gt;apologies to victims&lt;/a&gt; including the Reagan family; Jim and Sarah Brady; Secret Service Special Agent Tim McCarthy, D.C. police Officer Thomas Delahanty and to Foster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Weston said the court had had “very good reason” for caution, given what Hinckley did. She noted that Hinckley had received for his mental illness “a level of treatment most people don’t have access to and would greatly benefit from.” However, she said there is an “upside” in Hinckley’s rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“The government believes this case has shown and demonstrates the success that can come from a wraparound mental health system that really embraced Mr. Hinckley at every step of the process,” Weston said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Friedman recited the case’s long history Wednesday, recognizing the health and legal practitioners who worked on Hinckley’s case&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;over the decades. The judge noted that he and Levine had stewarded the case into their late 70s and that the judge&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;had served in the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. with Hinckley’s trial prosecutor,&lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/roger-m-adelman-federal-prosecutor-in-hinckley-trial-dies-at-74/2015/09/17/ff0d2606-5c88-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_30' target='_blank'&gt; Roger M.

Moss, a 2014 Obama appointee who served in the Clinton Justice Department from 1996 to 2001, including as head of the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the executive branch on such matters as executive privilege claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The Jan. 6 committee &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/09/navarro-subpoena/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9' target='_blank'&gt;subpoenaed Navarro&lt;/a&gt; in February seeking records and testimony from the former trade adviser, who has written and publicly discussed the effort to develop a strategy to delay or overturn certification of the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Navarro responded at the time with a statement rejecting the request and the committee’s legitimacy and blaming Pelosi, among others, for the violence that occurred Jan. 6, 2021. He argued that Trump “has invoked Executive Privilege; and it is not my privilege to waive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The House then &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/navarro-scavino-contempt-vote-house/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12' target='_blank'&gt;voted in April&lt;/a&gt; to hold Navarro and former White House communications chief Daniel Scavino Jr. in contempt of Congress, leading to criminal referrals to the Justice Department, which has the power to charge the two former officials with misdemeanors that can result in up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was trying to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election win. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people and injuries to about 140 members of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Navarro is among several Trump advisers who have been subpoenaed by the select committee and are seeking to avoid testifying by citing Trump’s claim of executive privilege. The panel &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/12/jan6-committee-subpoenas-mccarthy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_15' target='_blank'&gt;has also issued subpoenas to five House Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Two other former senior Trump White House aides have raised executive privilege claims in pending cases before a federal judge in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Like Navarro, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has sued the House Jan. 6 committee after receiving a subpoena. Former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon has moved to toss charges of criminal contempt of Congress after refusing to appear before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Both cases are before U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee who served in George W. Bush’s Justice Department from 2005 to 2009, including as principal deputy assistant attorney general in the civil division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In a February letter accompanying the original Navarro subpoena, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the select committee, cited news reports that the former Trump trade adviser “worked with Steve Bannon and others to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress’s certification of, and ultimately change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The letter also cited Navarro’s recent book, in which he detailed a plan he called “The Green Bay Sweep,” which he described as the “last best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats’ jaws of deceit.” The subpoena also described a Navarro report released online that repeated “many claims of purported fraud in the election that have been discredited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Navarro said in his lawsuit against Pelosi and the committee that he was directed to testify before a grand jury June 2 and present “[a]ll documents relating to the subpoena dated February 9, 2022” that he received from the committee, “including but not limited to any communications with formal [sic] President Trump and/or his counsel or representative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“As demonstrated in this brief, the executive privilege invoked by President Trump is not mine or Joe Biden’s to waive,” Navarro maintained. “Rather, as with the Committee, the U.S. Attorney has constitutional and due process obligations to negotiate my appearance before [the grand jury] not with me but rather with President Trump and his attorneys and I am bound by privilege to fail to comply with this Grand Jury Subpoena absent these negotiations and guidance from President Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacqueline Alemany and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A few weeks after the election was over, the first reports about that interference emerged, prompting Trump — smarting over having lost the popular vote — to disparage the idea that his victory was a function of anything other than his own aptitude. When BuzzFeed published the dossier of reports compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, Trump’s fury escalated. The Russia allegations were a “WITCH HUNT,” he wrote for the first time that same day. On the day following, he suggested that intelligence agencies had released the document, an act akin to “living in Nazi Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;This was more than a week before he even became president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Over time, a pattern emerged. Trump would make broad claims about how investigations into Russian interference — and, we later learned, contacts between his campaign team and Russian actors — were contrived to damage him personally. His allies would then scramble to prove him right either in the abstract or to validate the specific claims he had made, however loosely they could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And over and over and over those efforts to cast Trump as the victim of a plot aimed at undermining his candidacy or his presidency came up short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Two things bear mentioning at the outset. It is true that the investigation into Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team suffered from flaws and errors. It’s quite possible that no massive investigation could escape some level of error of the sorts exposed by the scrutiny paid to the Russia investigation, but it is true that the scrutiny paid here did reveal questionable actions and decisions that don’t alter our understanding of what occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The other thing worth mentioning is that the details were never the point. Trump’s play from the outset was to raise doubt and then simply refit the evidence as needed. His supporters always champion how he turned out to be “right” about various things, a function of ignoring all the times he was obviously wrong — the kid guessing a number between 1 and 10 who guesses each number and then claims he nailed it. The operating assumption is that Trump is right about being unfairly targeted by the Russia probe and so any new claim that bolsters that assumption is elevated — even after being debunked — until a new, not-yet-debunked claim emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;What triggered the Russia investigation is simple. Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election both through the much-hyped but less-significant effort to contribute to the social media conversation and through the hacking of the Democratic Party and a top adviser to Hillary Clinton. As this was known to be going on, federal investigators began investigating whether people close to Trump might have been actively working with Russia. People like Paul Manafort, his campaign manager and consultant to Russia-linked actors; and like Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser who had previously been identified as a target for Russian intelligence efforts and who traveled to Moscow in early July 2016; and like George Papadopoulos, another adviser who had been told by a guy who was helping him set up a meeting between Trump and Russia’s president that Russia had some of Clinton’s emails. That Russia had hacked the Democrats was known by mid-June 2016 and the Russia probe was opened by the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In the years since, that simple explanation for the investigation has been muddied by a variety of alternate theories, claims that objective analysis has shown to be either false or irrelevant to the central question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;These are those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;One of the first egregious claims Trump made about the Russia investigation was that it involved having the “wires tapped” at Trump Tower during the campaign. This would become a pattern: Trump would take &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/14/why-trump-is-once-again-claiming-that-he-was-spied-upon-2016/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'&gt;an overblown claim&lt;/a&gt; from conservative media and inflate it further. (There is no evidence that Trump Tower was wiretapped; the government has repeatedly denied that it did so.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Within days, Trump was &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/29/the-nunes-white-house-question-assessed-minute-by-minute/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that his unfounded assertion was proved right not by evidence of wiretapping but by evidence that communications involving a member of his transition team, Michael Flynn, had been “unmasked” by the administration of Barack Obama. It’s always been odd to try to conflate this with wiretapping Trump Tower unless you recognize the intermediate step: Trump Tower was wiretapped, meaning that Trump was spied on, meaning that anyone working with Trump being spied on validates the claim. This is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The “Flynn unmasking” argument was clunky, too, because it depended on understanding how surveillance works. The government monitors communications with people like the Russian ambassador. But since the CIA and NSA aren’t supposed to surveil American citizens, the identities of Americans talking to the ambassador are “masked,” which is to say anonymized. Other officials can ask that the identity be unmasked, however, to understand who’s talking to that ambassador in the first place. Which Obama officials did, learning the person talking to Russia’s ambassador was Flynn. (Incidentally, Flynn had visited Moscow in late 2015, sitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin &lt;a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696' target='_blank'&gt;at a dinner&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;This was trumpeted repeatedly as the Obama administration spying on Flynn and, therefore, Trump. But a review from Trump’s own Justice Department later determined that there was &lt;a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the unmasking was politically motivated. That Flynn later lied to investigators about the conversation, though, led to his pleading guilty to making false statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Shortly after the “unmasking” brouhaha, Trump’s irritation about the Russia probe led him to fire FBI Director James B. Comey (though Trump claimed this was about how the FBI handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server). Shortly thereafter, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was assigned to investigate Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team — an assignment made by a Trump appointee aimed at protecting the investigation from interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In the public sphere, the dossier published by BuzzFeed had attracted outsize attention, &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'&gt;despite obvious questions&lt;/a&gt; about what it alleged. Most media outlets treated it with skepticism or treated it as unconfirmed. As time passed and many of its claims remained unsubstantiated or had been undermined, it gained unexpected importance — among Trump’s &lt;i&gt;defenders&lt;/i&gt;. After all, if the dossier could be identified as the primary trigger for the Russia probe and it was contrived, that made the entire investigation dubious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;This line of argument became more appealing after it was learned that Steele had been hired by a firm called Fusion GPS that was itself hired by a law firm working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party. The line of argument skipped a few middle steps to become that Clinton had paid for a dossier of false claims — perhaps itself seeded by Russian intelligence! — and triggered the Russia probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The problem is that this assertion both ignores the known predicates for the Russia probe, and it doesn’t fit with the timeline of when the probe began. The FBI didn’t obtain the dossier until &lt;a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;mid-September 2016&lt;/a&gt;, according to an internal inspector general report, after the Russia investigation was already underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In 2018, it was revealed that the dossier had been an important part of an application to obtain a warrant surveilling Carter Page. That warrant, obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), included allegations from the dossier as a reason to surveil him. (The application acknowledged that Steele was “was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit” Trump’s campaign.) The warrant was granted and later renewed several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Only after Page left the campaign, however. When allegations from the Steele dossier were made public (apparently by Steele), Page resigned from the campaign. It was after that point that the surveillance warrant was granted. This problem with the timeline has been attributed to some multidimensional chess — that the warrant was a back door to investigate others close to Trump, for example — but that Page had previously been identified by a Russian intelligence agent as &lt;a href='https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/15/politics/russia-spy-recruitment-tactics-fbi-carter-page/index.html' target='_blank'&gt;a possible recruitment target&lt;/a&gt; seems salient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The dossier’s allegations have by now been &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/23/steele-dossier-igor-danchenko-indictment-scrutiny/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'&gt;shown to not be credible&lt;/a&gt;. There are valid questions about including its claims in the FISA warrant. But neither that warrant nor the dossier itself were predicates for the Russia investigation itself. For years, Trump and his allies have claimed that the Russia investigation stemmed from the dossier &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; it was sketchy and &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; it was paid for indirectly by lawyers working for Clinton. But that doesn’t make it true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;A few months after Mueller took over the Russia investigation, we learned that an FBI officials working on his team had been removed. That official, Peter Strzok, was a counterintelligence officer who had also been central to launching Crossfire Hurricane — the internal code name for the Russia investigation — in the first place. He was removed by Mueller after it was discovered that he had exchanged messages disparaging Trump and other elected officials with another FBI official, Lisa Page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Those messages launched a slew of arguments aimed at undermining the Russia investigation broadly. Strzok was accused of ginning up the probe out of animus toward Trump, a belief that a later investigation by the Justice Department inspector general &lt;a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;found to be unwarranted&lt;/a&gt;. His exchange with Page in which he referred to the need to probe possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia as being akin to a young person getting an “insurance policy” was repeatedly cited as evidence he wanted to blackmail Trump — although he &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/14/what-strzok-page-insurance-policy-text-was-actually-about/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40' target='_blank'&gt;explained credibly under oath&lt;/a&gt; that he was simply stating that they couldn’t allow the possibility of a connection to go unexamined in the event that Trump  won (which at the time seemed unlikely).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The huge trove of messages (which, despite a different set of rumors, were &lt;a href='https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-8227360079' target='_blank'&gt;not intentionally destroyed&lt;/a&gt;) allowed for Trump supporters to pick out various phrases as sinister or significant even when they weren’t. There was a brief flurry of attention paid to &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/24/russia-probe-theories-that-trump-has-empowered-barr-investigate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41' target='_blank'&gt;a message about “OCONUS lures”&lt;/a&gt; — an apparent reference to informants outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). But this was part of Strzok’s job and was not shown to be related to the Russia probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;That particular idea gained some traction after it was revealed that the FBI had &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is-no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'&gt;employed a confidential informant&lt;/a&gt; to probe members of Trump’s team. This was dubbed Spygate and became Trump’s new explanation for how he was right about having been under surveillance all along. (Trump &lt;a href='https://apnews.com/23b9456c12484b6cb31c93da269a6159/Seething-over-Russia-probe,-Trump-tears-into-%27spygate' target='_blank'&gt;told an ally&lt;/a&gt; that he liked to call the informant a “spy” specifically for the pejorative connotations.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;That informant, though, reached out to Carter Page and George Papadopoulos only after they were already on the FBI’s radar screen. That same inspector general report determined that there was “no evidence that the FBI used CHSs” — confidential human sources — “or UCEs” — undercover employees — “to interact with members of the Trump campaign prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“After the opening of the investigation,” it continues, “we found no evidence that the FBI placed any CHSs or UCEs within the Trump campaign or tasked any CHSs or UCEs to report on the Trump campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;As should be obvious, that inspector general report did a lot to undercut the narratives promoted by Trump and his allies. So, as soon as it came out, Attorney General William P. Barr released a statement in concert with U.S. Attorney John Durham &lt;a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/barr-durham-ig-report-russia-investigation.html' target='_blank'&gt;undercutting its determinations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;By then, Durham had already been tapped to conduct an investigation into the investigation: to figure out whether Trump’s efforts to cast himself as unfairly targeted held water. The inspector general report, by making an objective assessment that it didn’t, stepped on Durham’s (and therefore Barr’s and therefore Trump’s) toes, hence the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Durham and Barr began scouring the available evidence, going so far as to &lt;a href='https://www.thedailybeast.com/barr-went-to-rome-to-hear-a-secret-tape-from-joseph-mifsud-the-professor-who-helped-ignite-the-russia-probe' target='_blank'&gt;travel to Italy&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate whether the understood predicate for the investigation — Papadopoulos being told that Russia had Clinton emails — was valid. But, for months, no alternate explanation emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Before Trump left office, Durham’s role was shifted to special counsel, giving him the same protection from President Biden that Mueller had from Trump. But Durham has not produced much. He obtained an &lt;a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/russian-national-indicted-making-false-statements-fbi' target='_blank'&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt; against Igor Danchenko, one of the sources for the Steele dossier and one &lt;a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/grand-jury-indicts-dc-attorney-making-false-statements-fbi-2016-regarding-alleged' target='_blank'&gt;against an attorney&lt;/a&gt; who worked for the law firm employed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Which brings us to this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In October 2020, the campaign looming, the political ally Trump put in charge of the national intelligence directorate &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'&gt;released a lette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'&gt;r&lt;/a&gt; pointedly suggesting that the Russia investigation was a function of Clinton’s campaign. The evidence? Apparently that the CIA had identified discussion among Russian sources alleging that Clinton had approved a campaign message trying to link Trump to Russia on July 26, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;This was, in fact, five days before Crossfire Hurricane was launched. But it was after there were already &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/the-trump-russia-money-question-in-24-steps/?itid=lk_inline_manual_58' target='_blank'&gt;numerous public questions&lt;/a&gt; about Trump’s connections to and sympathies toward Russia and Putin. That Russia got intelligence that Clinton had made linking Trump to Russia part of her campaign strategy in late July is both unremarkable (her campaign manager, Robby Mook, had already raised it in television interviews) and unrelated to the FBI probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The appeal here is obvious, though, as it was with the Steele dossier. Blaming Clinton for the Russia probe scratches two itches at once: casts Trump as innocent and Clinton as guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Durham’s indictment of Michael Sussman, the attorney who worked for the firm hired by Clinton’s campaign, prompted a flurry of similar allegations. He had come to the FBI with &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?itid=lk_inline_manual_60' target='_blank'&gt;a dubious claim&lt;/a&gt; about a connection between Trump’s private company and a Russian bank — which to Trump supporters became proof that Clinton had tried to gin up this controversy and therefore the Russia probe. But that allegation was incidental to the Russia investigation (far more even than the Carter Page FISA warrant), coming months after the investigation began. During Sussman’s trial, Mook testified that Clinton had approved a messaging campaign elevating the dubious claim, an admission that titillated Fox News types. But it was completely irrelevant to the Russia investigation. Like the October 2020 story, it was about campaign messaging, not federal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The Sussman prosecution included other efforts to elevate minor points as dispositive of Trump’s having been unfairly targeted. There was the flutter of excitement over the Trump White House having been surveilled by Sussman as &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/18/john-durham-dumps-small-bucket-water-forest-fire-he-sparked/?itid=lk_inline_manual_61' target='_blank'&gt;hinted at in a Durham court filing&lt;/a&gt; — but that didn’t happen. Instead, researchers who were clients of Sussman’s had obtained data from the White House during the Obama administration that they had analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;One would think that, by that point, Trump’s allies would be skeptical of new assertions about how the Russia investigation began. After all, not only have there been repeated claims about what happened that have been shown to be baseless, but there also has been nothing that has undercut the official story about how the probe began (even after Barr and Durham went to Italy in the apparent hope of doing so).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But, again, the point isn’t the evidence. The point is the belief that Trump was unfairly accused. That belief is not driven by evidence, so it can’t be undercut by a lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;It is still important to note that there is no evidence for it. And not for lack of trying to find some.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This fed into long-running allegations of the government “spying” on Trump, who chose Flynn as his national security adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;We knew before that this theory had fallen apart. We now know just how spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;BuzzFeed News late Tuesday revealed &lt;a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'&gt;a previously top-secret Justice Department report&lt;/a&gt; that details the findings of a review ordered by Trump’s attorney general, William P. Barr. The report is a resounding rejection of the conspiracy theories, which were seeded and fertilized throughout Trump’s four years in office by Trump allies and GOP members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Essentially, the idea was that the Obama officials might have sought the identity of Flynn in intelligence detailing his December 2016 calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and then leaked details for political purposes. (Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI about these calls.) And there were valid questions early on about the Obama administration’s use of unmasking, &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/04/susan-rice-isnt-a-smoking-gun-but-she-does-have-some-explaining-to-do/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9' target='_blank'&gt;as we wrote in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;But the allegations almost always went beyond the known facts. And now the Justice Department report affirms that the allegations went way beyond what actually happened, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-qa='article-video' class=''&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid='video-wrapper'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In &lt;a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22046897-leopold-foia-john-bash-unmasking-report' target='_blank'&gt;his newly revealed report from September 2020&lt;/a&gt;, then-U.S. Attorney John Bash found “no unmasking requests made before Election Day that sought the identity of an apparent associate of the Trump campaign.” He said much the same about the transition period between Election Day 2016 and Trump’s inauguration in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I … examined whether any senior officials had obtained General Flynn’s identity in connection with those communications through an unmasking request made during the transition period,” Bash wrote. “The answer is no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“According to the FBI, the Bureau did not disseminate an intelligence report discussing those communications and containing masked [U.S. person identity information] for General Flynn before President Trump’s inauguration,” Bash wrote. “For that reason, the public disclosure of the communications could not have resulted from an unmasking request.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Bash said the FBI’s version “is consistent with my review of unmasking records, which did not reveal any unmasking request corresponding to a report discussing those communications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Bash’s big conclusion: “I have not found evidence that senior U.S. officials unmasked the identities of U.S. persons contained in intelligence reports for political purposes or other inappropriate reasons during the 2016 election period or the ensuing transition period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Flynn’s contact with Kislyak was first revealed &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-did-obama-dawdle-on-russias-hacking/2017/01/12/75f878a0-d90c-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'&gt;by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius on Jan. 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;. In a telephone call, the two discussed sanctions during a conversation that might have run afoul of an unenforced federal law called the &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/28/democrats-think-donald-trump-just-violated-the-logan-act-what-is-that/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'&gt;Logan Act&lt;/a&gt;. But speaking to the FBI later, Flynn denied having discussed sanctions. He pleaded guilty to that offense, but Barr’s Justice Department later made the extraordinary decision to try to have the case dismissed, and &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynn-trump-pardon/2020/11/25/3cd79198-2e65-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'&gt;a lame-duck President Trump pardoned Flynn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Bash’s report becomes public after we already knew his review had resulted in no criminal charges. The &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/barr-unmasking-review-no-charges/2020/10/13/0f63fd2e-0d67-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_22' target='_blank'&gt;Washington Post’s Matt Zapotosky and Shane Harris reported&lt;/a&gt; in October 2020 that the review had quietly ended. Now we know it didn’t just come up shy of chargeable crimes; it also found virtually nothing to substantiate the various claims made by Trump and his allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And that’s pretty far from how this was often pitched on the right. Often, it wasn’t just “this seems fishy”; it was that “this is a proven scandal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;After Ignatius’s report, a Bloomberg News columnist reported in April 2017 that former Obama national security adviser &lt;a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-04-03/top-obama-adviser-sought-names-of-trump-associates-in-intel' target='_blank'&gt;Susan Rice had requested unmaskings&lt;/a&gt; in intelligence reports related to Trump’s campaign and transition period. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) declared it to be a “smoking gun” and claimed it amounted to “spying on Trump campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-oembed-type='twitter' class='' style='min-height:171px'&gt;&lt;blockquote class='twitter-tweet'&gt;&lt;p lang='en' dir='ltr'&gt;Smoking gun found!

&lt;script async='' src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board went so far as to declare that “Rice would have had &lt;a href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-rice-unmasked-1491262064?platform=hootsuite' target='_blank'&gt;no obvious need to unmask Trump campaign officials other than political curiosity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Rice didn’t do herself many favors by making some &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/04/susan-rice-isnt-a-smoking-gun-but-she-does-have-some-explaining-to-do/?itid=lk_inline_manual_30' target='_blank'&gt;confusing comments about the matter&lt;/a&gt;. But even at the time, it was apparent that there were actually &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-decries-media-lack-of-interest-in-reports-of-obama-officials-spying/2017/04/03/bd8650fe-18b6-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_12&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_30' target='_blank'&gt;many reasons to believe this was business as usual&lt;/a&gt; for someone in her position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The conspiracy theory simmered for a couple years, until Republican senators in the 2020 election year &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/michael-flynn-unmasking-obama-biden/2020/05/13/d9593030-9545-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_31'&gt;released a list&lt;/a&gt; of Obama administration officials who had allegedly requested Flynn’s unmasking — information that had been provided by then-acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;And again, many on the right, despite the dearth of any truly damning information, &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/21/obamagate-suffers-another-significant-blow/?itid=lk_inline_manual_33' target='_blank'&gt;skipped right over any plausible alternative explanations&lt;/a&gt; for how Flynn’s name would’ve become known. They did so even as The Washington Post’s Ellen Nakashima broke the news that &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/michael-flynns-name-was-never-masked-in-fbi-document-on-his-communications-with-russian-ambassador/2020/05/20/e94ee050-9a0b-11ea-ac72-3841fcc9b35f_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_33' target='_blank'&gt;Flynn’s name had never been masked in the first place&lt;/a&gt;. They did so even as one of their own, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), asked why Grenell’s list conspicuously “&lt;a href='https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20from%20LOG%20to%20Grenell%20and%20Barr%20re%20unmasking%2005-19-20.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;did not contain a record showing who unmasked General Flynn’s identity&lt;/a&gt; for his phone call with Ambassador Kislyak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Conservative journalist John Solomon declared that a “crime is certain to have been committed.” Fox News’s Laura Ingraham wagered that such information had definitely been illegally leaked to the media. Paul again &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/seven-days-of-obamagate-how-a-flynn-theory-became-central-to-the-trump-reelection-campaign/2020/05/14/e698bfba-960b-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'&gt;invoked the smoking gun&lt;/a&gt;: “We sort of have the smoking gun because we now have the declassified document with Joe Biden’s name on it.” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) called it “&lt;a href='https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/15/john-cornyn-unmasking-michael-flynn-bigger-waterga/'&gt;bigger than Watergate&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Bash’s report finds not only that there was no &lt;i&gt;inappropriate&lt;/i&gt; unmasking, but also that the claims about all those Obama officials supposedly requesting unmaskings in Grenell’s declassified report were badly overcooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“Most critically, all but one of the requests that listed a senior official as an authorized recipient of General Flynn’s identity were made by an intelligence professional to prepare for a briefing of the official, not at the direction of the official,” Bash wrote, adding: “Nothing about the content suggests that officials were seeking derogatory information about General Flynn or were otherwise inappropriately targeting him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;There was indeed something of a high temperature wafting over the supposed scandal, but rather than smoke, it was hot air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Robert Wallach, a California lawyer who came to Washington in the early 1980s as an adviser to presidential counselor Edwin Meese III, only to become a central figure in the Reagan-era Wedtech bribery scandal, in which he was first convicted and later freed after defending himself in court, died May 15 at his home in Alameda, Calif. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The death was announced by the San Francisco law firm of Rains Lucia Stern, where Mr. Wallach worked in recent years. The cause was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Early in his career, Mr. Wallach established a reputation as one of California’s top trial lawyers, winning the state’s first million-dollar settlement in a medical malpractice case, followed by a $3.6 million verdict in New Mexico, after a child suffered brain damage at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In San Francisco, he was known as a liberal Democrat who briefly sought the U.S. Senate nomination in 1976 as a supporter of gay rights and legalized marijuana. By 1980, Mr. Wallach had become a supporter of the presidential campaign of Republican Ronald Reagan, largely because of his friendship with Meese, one of Reagan’s top advisers. Meese had been Mr. Wallach’s law school classmate and moot court partner at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;After Reagan’s election, Mr. Wallach came to Washington as an informal adviser to Meese, who was counselor to the president before becoming attorney general in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mr. Wallach was named a U.S. Representative for Human Rights and served on the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, but beyond sharing lunches and memos with Meese, he exercised little real authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Early in 1981, Mr. Wallach became the conduit to the Reagan administration for Wedtech, a small manufacturing firm in the Bronx seeking leverage on Pentagon projects. The company’s owners, unschooled in the ways of Washington, had hired a private detective to find out why they weren’t winning defense contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I didn’t think investigating the secretary of the Army and some procurement officers was going to help,” the detective, Harold Lipset, told The Washington Post in 1987. “I thought they needed a lobbyist in Washington and [Mr. Wallach] was the only one I knew who knew somebody in Washington.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mr. Wallach, who had spent his early years in New York City, saw the company’s blue-collar executives as the kind of scrappy underdogs he had been as a young man. He wrote memos to Meese touting Wedtech as an inspiring company on the rise, and Reagan praised it in speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Over the next few years, Wedtech landed Pentagon contracts worth an estimated $250 million, many of them awarded on a no-bid basis. Mr. Wallach admitted he had pocketed at least $1.3 million in stocks and fees as he helped the company gain a foothold in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;As Wedtech struggled to fulfill its contracts, federal prosecutors bought charges of bribery, racketeering and fraud against company officials, who had rewarded themselves with expensive cars and lavish meals. Several political figures were also swept up in the widening scandal, including Mr. Wallach, former White House communications director &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2006/03/28/strategist-reagan-adviser-lyn-nofziger/7b36b6f6-2b87-415a-b7a6-eabe5e94d392/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'&gt;Lyn Nofziger&lt;/a&gt; and members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;In the end, more than 20 people were convicted in federal court. U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and former Bronx borough president Stanley Simon each spent more than two years in prison on corruption charges. Meese was not prosecuted, but in the midst of the scandal he resigned from his post as attorney general in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mr. Wallach was convicted of racketeering in 1989 and sentenced to six years in prison, leading to the temporary suspension of his law practice in California while he appealed the decision. His conviction was overturned in 1991, after a key witness was found to have committed perjury. (Nofziger and others similarly had their convictions reversed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Still, Mr. Wallach’s legal troubles were not over, and in 1993 he faced a new trial in New York on similar charges. He refused to make a plea deal, maintaining he had never committed a crime in promoting Wedtech to federal officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Having spent more than $1 million on his defense and still owing more than $700,000, Mr. Wallach was reduced to acting as his own attorney almost out of desperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“If I get convicted a second time, I have nothing left,” he said. “I will lose everything, including my livelihood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;When the arguments were finished, the deadlocked jury could not reach a decision. The judge dismissed all charges against Mr. Wallach, who went back to San Francisco to rebuild his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Eugene Robert Wallach was born on April 11, 1934, in New York City. His parents worked in a hat factory and divorced when their son was 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;He moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where she worked in an airplane assembly plant during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mr. Wallach was a champion debater in high school and graduated in 1955 from the University of Southern California. As a law student at Berkeley, he became especially close to Meese, as they studied together in the Meese family basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“I used to love going to their home,” he told journalist James Traub for his 1990 book about the Wedtech scandal, “Too Good to Be True.” “Ed and I were writing briefs down in the basement, his mother would come down with the sandwiches. It was right out of ‘Andy Hardy.’ It was the kind of home I had never experienced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;After graduating in 1958, Mr. Wallach joined a San Francisco law firm, then called Walkup &amp; Downing, and soon became recognized as a top courtroom advocate. He established a solo practice in 1971 and was known for a string of victories, often in cases involving accidents or medical malpractice. One of his courtroom victories, involving Girl Scouts burned in a car crash, led to the adoption of median barriers on some California highways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“He was known as being the best lawyer in the courtroom in front of a jury,” Eustace de St. Phalle, a partner at Rains Lucia Stern, said in an interview. “He was always listening and was a great strategist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;As Mr. Wallach’s legal reputation grew, he cultivated an air of eccentricity: He became known as “e. bob” — spelling his name without capital letters — and often went out in public with an exotic Saluki dog. He wore a yellow rose in his lapel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;He was married two times, to Barbara Wallach and later to Glenda Jones. Survivors include three daughters from his first marriage and seven grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;After returning to San Francisco, Mr. Wallach represented the Fang family as it purchased the San Francisco Examiner newspaper in 2000 from the Hearst company. He was also the longtime corporate counsel of the Sharper Image retail firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mr. Wallach taught at several Bay Area law schools and was an informal mentor to countless lawyers. He joined Rains Lucia Stern in 2016 and continued to practice law through 2019. According to the firm, he tried 283 cases that reached a verdict — and lost only 14 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“The only thing I’m guilt-ridden about,” Mr. Wallach said in 1993, “is my stupidity and poor judgment in venturing off into the minefields of Washington.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She was 94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Her son Kurt Wurzberger confirmed her death and said he did not know the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;The daughter of a Democratic congressman and then senator from Idaho, Mrs. Reynolds came of age in Washington in the 1930s and ’40s, a time when most women could scarcely imagine pursuing professional lives like the one she eventually achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Her career began in the 1950s on a dare.

She also covered politics and interviewed Ronald Reagan when the former Hollywood actor ran for California governor in 1966, making the connection that would shape much of the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;After winning the gubernatorial election that year, Reagan hired Mrs. Reynolds as an assistant press secretary and later special assistant.

Commission on the Status of Women, and in 1985 she served as co-chair of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Decade for Women World Conference in Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mrs. Reynolds’s ties with the Reagans made her a sought-after figure in Washington, particularly when she partnered with Anne Wexler to form one of the city’s first bipartisan lobbying operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Wexler, a former aide to President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, had already established Washington’s first major lobbying outfit run by a woman. Mrs. Reynolds joined the firm in 1983, making it a formidable cross-aisle force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Because they were women, Wexler was said to have told Mrs. Reynolds that “we’re going to be underestimated, and it’ll work every time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;They became, in the &lt;a href='https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/12/us/a-lobbying-firm-specializing-in-bipartisanship.html' target='_blank'&gt;description&lt;/a&gt; of the New York Times, “two of the best-known political operatives in the capital,” with clients including General Motors, American Airlines and MCI Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;“The name of the consulting game is how many people you know and the ease with which you can call them and ask them questions, if nothing else,” Mrs. Reynolds &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1992/08/02/the-privatization-of-craig-fuller/f910e860-076c-487d-9bc0-d9a0db5d9850/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. “Everybody is dependent on everybody else here. It’s a friendly feeding game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Nancy Worth Clark was born in Pocatello, Idaho, on June 26, 1927. Her mother was a homemaker and volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Her father, David Worth Clark, served in the U.S. House from 1935 to 1939 and then in the Senate until 1945. The Clark side of the family produced two Democratic governors of Idaho in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Barzilla Clark and Chase Clark. An uncle on Mrs. Reynolds’s maternal side, Robert E. Smylie, was a Republican who served as Idaho governor from 1955 to 1967. (Mrs. Reynolds, for her part, told Washingtonian that she became a Republican after interviewing &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm?itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'&gt;Sen. Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt; of Arizona, the conservative standard-bearer who was the GOP nominee for president in 1964.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;During her father’s time in Washington, Mrs. Clark and her family lived in the Shoreham hotel, prompting &lt;a href='https://www.washingtonian.com/2007/06/01/golden-girl/' target='_blank'&gt;Washingtonian to describe&lt;/a&gt; her as “D.C.’s Eloise,” a reference to the protagonist of the children’s picture book series by Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight about a precocious girl who lives in New York City’s Plaza Hotel. Mrs. Reynolds recalled her father playing poker with President Harry S. Truman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;She was a 1945 graduate of Immaculata high school in Washington and received a bachelor’s degree in English from Goucher College in Baltimore in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;After her first marriage, to Bill Wurzberger, ended in divorce, Mrs. Reynolds returned to Idaho, where she hosted a daytime talk show before moving to California. Between Reagan’s time in the California governor’s mansion and his election to the White House,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;she did lobbying work for Boise Cascade, an Idaho-based manufacturer and supplier of building materials, and for Bendix, a manufacturing concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'&gt;Mrs. Reynolds served for a period as president of Wexler, Reynolds, Harrison &amp; Schule, as the firm she formed with Wexler was formally known.
