He doesn't care what a student's GPA is or if their family has a criminal history.&nbsp;</p><p>'[There are] enough barriers and obstacles put up against these folks,' Kadens said.

The demand for 'pandemic puppies' has fallen, as people return to work. One possible solution is fostering.</p><p>'All shelters across the country need your help. And one of the biggest ways you can help is by fostering,' said Melissa Knicely, a spokesperson for Charlotte Animal Care and Control.</p><p>Right now there’s no shortage of bigger breeds at Knicely’s shelter. Its dog kennels are at 100% capacity, and they have not dropped below 85% capacity in the past year, which is considered a critical capacity. She says, ideally, their cages would be about half full.</p><p>'It is stressful. You hear all the barking? It’s stressful. You get these animals into a home. They get comfortable. You start knowing their personalities,' she said.</p><p>Knicely says that's why fostering is catching on more at shelters. She says about half of the people who foster a dog end up adopting them. And even if they don’t adopt, fostering can help the shelter understand how a dog behaves around families or other pets for an extended period.</p><p>'We have so much information to share to find the right home for that dog,' Knicely said.&nbsp;</p><p>'Staffing has been an issue from the start of the pandemic, as you can imagine. That's why it’s so important to have people step up and volunteer and foster,' said Kitty Block, the President and CEO of the Humane society of the United States.</p><p>The Humane Society says an overabundance of dogs isn't the only problem for some shelters — staffing is too. Right now Charlotte Animal Care and Control could hire 13 people on the spot, but finding people to hire is a struggle, Knicely said.</p><p>As far as adopting a dog goes, the Humane Society says some people are being priced out because of inflation.</p><p>'It’s very hard to find affordable housing that allows pets,' Block said.</p><p>You can foster a dog for anywhere from one day to several months depending on the organization and the needs of the dog. And sometimes fostering a dog can leave space at the shelter for animals who need special care or management.</p><p>'When you foster one animal, you’re really saving two. Because you’re saving the animal that you’re fostering, and you’re making room for the next animal that needs that spot at the shelter,' Knicely said.</p><p>Knicely says that cats are being adopted at a much quicker rate. Possibly because they fit more easily into people’s busy schedules.</p> <!---->"

      "description": "<p class='speakable'>A scientific analysis commissioned by the FBI shortly before agents went digging for buried treasure suggested that a huge quantity of gold could be below the surface, according to newly released government documents and photos that deepen the mystery of the 2018 excavation in remote western <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania' target='_blank'>Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p class='speakable'>The report, by a geophysicist who performed microgravity testing at the site, hinted at an underground object with a mass of up to 9 tons and a density consistent with gold. The FBI used the consultant’s work to obtain a warrant to seize the gold — if there was any to be found.</p><p>The government has long claimed its dig was a bust. But a father-son pair of treasure hunters who spent years hunting for the fabled Civil War-era gold — and who led agents to the woodland site, hoping for a finder’s fee — suspect the FBI double-crossed them and made off with a cache that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>The newly revealed geophysical survey was part of a court-ordered release of government records on the FBI’s treasure hunt at Dent’s Run, about 135 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, where legend says an 1863 shipment of Union gold was either lost or stolen on its way to the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/philadelphia' target='_blank'>U.S. Mint in Philadelphia</a>.</p><div source='Associated Press' class='image-ct inline'><div class='m'><picture><source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1470/828/16fc9832-1000-10.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'><source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1862/1048/16fc9832-1000-10.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'> <img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/640/320/16fc9832-1000-10.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Dennis Parada, right, and his son Kem Parada stand at the site of the FBI's dig for Civil War-era gold in Sept, 2018, in Dents Run, Pennsylvania.'></picture></div> </div><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/treasure-hunters-sue-civil-war-gold-dig' target='_blank'><strong>FLASHBACK: PENNSYLVANIA TREASURE HUNTERS SUE FOR RECORDS ON FBI'S CIVIL WAR-ERA GOLD DIG</strong></a></p><p>Dennis and Kem Parada, who co-own the treasure-hunting outfit Finders Keepers, successfully <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department' target='_blank'>sued the Justice Department</a> for the records after being stonewalled by the FBI. Finders Keepers provided the FBI records to The Associated Press. The FBI subsequently posted them on its website.</p><p>The technical survey data collected by geophysical consulting firm Enviroscan gave credence to the treasure hunters’ own extensive fieldwork at the site — and prompted the FBI to excavate in a massive, secretive operation that lasted for several frigid days in late winter of 2018.</p><p>John Louie, a geophysics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, unconnected to the dig, reviewed Enviroscan’s report at the request of the AP and said the firm’s 'methods were very good,' and 'their conclusions represent a physically reasonable hypothesis' that gold was buried at the site.</p><p>But he cautioned the subsurface gravity anomaly that Enviroscan identified did not definitively establish the presence of gold. There are other technical reasons why Enviroscan’s data could have turned out the way it did, Louie said.</p><p>'Thus, it is also entirely reasonable that the FBI did not find anything at the site, because there was not really any gold there,' he said via email.</p><p>Enviroscan co-founder Tim Bechtel declined to comment about his work at Dent’s Run, saying the FBI has not given him permission to talk. The FBI would not discuss Bechtel this week but said that after the dig, agents 'did not take any subsequent steps to reconcile the geophysical-survey findings with the absence of gold or any other metal.'</p><p>Other documents in the just-released FBI case file raise still more questions.</p><p>A one-paragraph FBI report, dated March 13, 2019 — exactly one year after the dig — asserted agents found nothing at Dent’s Run. No 'metals, items, and/or other relevant materials were found,' the report said.

'If that is the official record in the file of what they did and why they did it, it says almost nothing, and it’s crazy.'</p><p>She added that if the government does not produce a fuller, more contemporaneous accounting of its search for the gold, it 'will heighten my view that this is not an accurate record and this was created as a cover-up. And I don’t say that lightly.'</p><p>In response, the FBI said the single-page document 'is representative of the standard summaries filed when formally closing an FBI investigation.'</p><p>The agency has consistently denied it found anything.</p><p>Agents acted on information that Dent’s Run 'may have been a cultural heritage site containing gold belonging to the United States government,' the FBI said in a statement, but 'that possibility was not borne out by the excavation. The FBI continues to unequivocally reject any claims or speculation to the contrary.'</p><p>The trove of documents turned over to Finders Keepers also included nearly 1,000 photos, in grainy black-and-white, that show some — but certainly not all — of what the FBI was doing at the dig site, according to the treasure hunters.</p><p>Residents have previously told of hearing a backhoe and jackhammer overnight between the first and second days of the dig — when the work was supposed to have been paused — and seeing a convoy of FBI vehicles, including large armored trucks.</p><div videoid='5846570439001' videodomain='foxnews' class='related video-ct'><div class='m'><a href='http://video.foxnews.com/v/5846570439001' target='_blank'><img src='https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/10/09/694940094001_5846570387001_5846570439001-vs.jpg' alt='Treasure hunters: FBI acting suspiciously over Civil War-era gold '> <span class='overlay'></span></a></div> </div><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-goodwill-ancient-roman-bust' target='_blank'><strong>GOODWILL FIND IN TEXAS TURNS OUT TO BE ANCIENT ROMAN BUST</strong></a></p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi' target='_blank'>The FBI </a>denied any work took place at the site after hours, saying the 'only nighttime activity was ATV patrols by FBI Police personnel, who secured the site around the clock for the duration of the excavation.'</p><p>Parada suspects the FBI retrieved the gold in the middle of the night and then showed the treasure hunters an empty hole on the afternoon of the second day.</p><p>'It’s very curious why the FBI is going to such an extent to misdirect and be so obstructionist on this,' said Warren Getler, who has worked closely with the treasure hunters. 'They worked that night under cover of darkness to evade, escape our knowledge of something we’re supposed to be partners in.'</p><p>Many of the FBI photos are seemingly irrelevant, including the hundreds of images of random trees and a woodland road leading to the dig site, while others simply don’t add up or raise additional questions, assert Parada and Getler, author of 'Rebel Gold,' a book exploring the possibility of buried Civil War-era caches of gold and silver.</p><p>FBI agents are shown standing around the hole in photos that appear earlier in the series, but they are absent from nearly all of the later images at the dig site.</p><p>Getler and Parada say the lead FBI agent told them the hole was filled with water the morning of the second day, but the low-quality images released by the government show only a small puddle or perhaps a bit of snow. They said that same agent spent most of the second day at base camp — where Getler and the treasure hunters say they were largely confined to their car — and not at the dig site.</p><p>The FBI said it’s standard for photos to 'document site conditions before, during, and after FBI operations,' Parada claims it all points to a clandestine overnight dig and a second-day excavation that was just for show.</p><p>'I think we were expecting a couple hundred photos of the night dig, and I think we were expecting pictures of metal coins or bars,' Parada said. 'I think there were pictures, but they disappeared.'</p><p>The FBI records also show that several weeks before the excavation, an agent with the agency’s art crime team approached Wells Fargo to ask whether it shipped gold by stagecoach for the U.S. Mint in 1863.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history' target='_blank'>Wells Fargo historians</a> turned up no evidence of it but said records from the era are incomplete. Wells Fargo did ship gold by stagecoach, a corporate archivist wrote in an email to the FBI, but large quantities of the precious metal, as well as gold that had to be carried long distances, were 'better transported by ship or train.'</p><p>Getler said the gold might have been transported by wagon, not stagecoach.</p><p>Additional FBI releases are expected over the coming months.</p> <!---->"

'There is no doubt about the intent of these suspects when the messages and images they sent are reviewed.'&nbsp;</p><p>'That’s why it’s important for parents to know who their children are communicating with online because sexual predators are looking for opportunities to exploit them,' the sheriff added.

'That includes cyber criminals holding data for ransom and nation-states like China stealing defense and industrial secrets and lately, that's included Russia trying to influence what happens in the ground war.'</p><p>Wray spoke at the Boston Conference on Cybersecurity, outlining the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-evolving-intelligence-suggesting-possible-russian-cyberattacks-against-us' target='_blank'>various threats to American citizens and infrastructure</a> that rogue operators and rival states pose.&nbsp;</p><p>'We've got a 24/7 Cyber Command post running, and we've been pushing out intelligence products and technical indicators, not just to government partners, but also to private companies and others,' Wray explained.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-cybercapabilities-quantum-computing-answer' target='_blank'><strong>RUSSIA SHOWN ONLY SOME CYBERCAPABILITIES, BUT US HAS QUANTUM COMPUTING ANSWER TO POSSIBLE THREATS</strong></a></p><p>The director outlined how these rival states look to utilize cyber warfare in times of conflict and against civilian targets: He discussed how ransomware 'gangs,' often state-sponsored, will attack everything from <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/colonial-pipeline-goes-back-online-after-cyberattack-forced-shutdown' target='_blank'>oil and gas pipelines</a> to schools and local governments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wray claimed that in 2021 the FBI recorded ransomware attacks 'against 14 of the 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors,' which includes health care and 'a lot of other things we depend on.'&nbsp;</p><p>'Last May, for example, the FBI’s cyber team here in Boston uncovered important indicators of compromise for the Avadon ransomware strain,' Wray said. 'Avadon was one of the most prolific ransomware variants in the world at the time. Our folks quickly published what they found to warn the public.'&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-police-use-of-force-public-distrust' target='_blank'><strong>FBI RELEASES NEW DETAILS ON POLICE USE OF FORCE AS PUBLIC GRAPPLES WITH DISTRUST</strong></a></p><p>'Just two days after that, a local police department out in the Southwest told FBI Boston that they'd seen some of those indicators of compromise,' he continued. 'The police department was able to use our Boston division's information to stop Avadon from infecting their network. So that's our folks here helping out a city clear on the other side of the country.'</p><p>Another such example included an attack from Iran-backed hackers who in 2001 tried to attack Boston Children’s Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>'We got a report from one of our intelligence partners indicating Boston Children's was about to be targeted and understanding the urgency of the situation, the cyber squad in our Boston field office raced out to notify the hospital,' Wray revealed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-offers-10-million-reward-russian-hackers' target='_blank'><strong>STATE DEPARTMENT OFFERS $10 MILLION REWARD IN SEARCH FOR RUSSIAN HACKERS</strong></a></p><p>'It's a great example of why we deploy in the field the way we do, enabling that kind of immediately before the catastrophe strikes response,' he added. 'Unfortunately, hospitals these days and a lot of other providers of critical infrastructure have even more to worry about than Iranian government hackers.'&nbsp;</p><p>The key to fending off <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cybercrime' target='_blank'>ransomware and foreign state attacks</a> will rest in creating a 'continuous' flow of information between state and private entities in the U.S. to ensure that any new information can reach the most critical areas before those vulnerabilities can be exploited.&nbsp;</p><p>'What we need to do is kick off a virtuous cycle that feeds on itself where we use the information from one company that gives us to develop information about whom the adversary is, what they're doing, where, why, how taking pains to protect that company's identity, just as we do with other sources we have,' Wray argued.&nbsp;</p><p>'And then when we pass what we develop to our partners here, and abroad, our fellow U.S. and foreign intelligence services, foreign law enforcement, a sector, risk management agencies, providers like Microsoft.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <!---->"

Why are they going to waste their limited time and resources arresting or investigating crimes that they know that the district attorney has said he or she is going to prosecute? … It leads to under-enforcement of crime overall,' Smith continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Former Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Joe Sullivan added in an interview with Fox News Digital that laws restricting who officers pull over or not prosecuting crimes such as shoplifting are 'absolutely' adding to the crime spike of 2022, describing it as 'normalizing deviancy.'&nbsp;</p><p>'We're sending a message that … you don't have to obey the law. You don't have to obey police officers. You can pretty much do as you want. And as we head into the warmer weather, I think we're already having some serious consequences,' Sullivan said, citing Chicago's recent curfew announcement for minors to help curb crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Traffic stops are the most common interaction police have with the public, with officers nationwide making roughly 50,000 traffic stops per day, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project. Fox News Digital also spoke with the Heritage Foundation’s senior legal fellow Cully Stimson, who pointed to a recent 'Rogue Prosecutor Symposium' held by the think tank where experts discussed how stops for low-level infractions can often lead to the apprehension of a person who is connected to other more serious crimes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/murders-rose-study-2021' target='_blank'><strong><u>MURDERS ROSE 5% IN 2021 COMPARED TO 2020; 44% COMPARED TO 2019: STUDY</u></strong></a></p><p>'If you find people, and you pull them over for a minor traffic infraction and then you find they have a warrant [or] you find out somebody in the car with him has a warrant. And so you want people to enforce the law because by enforcing the law, you end up stumbling into other situations where people have open warrants,' he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Stimson and Smith both explained that something as seemingly innocuous as not cracking down on turnstile jumping can embolden criminals. Former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue was among the experts who spoke at Heritage’s 'Rogue Prosecutor Symposium' and argued that prosecuting quality of life crimes - like turnstile jumping or low-level drug offenses -&nbsp;is 'incredibly important.'</p><p>'A lot of cases, significant cases, in New York City history have been made … starting with a turnstile jumping case, right? Because the guy who jumps the turnstile has a gun and the gun is linked to a murder and so on and so forth,' Donoghue said at the symposium. 'And so those crimes matter. Enforcement of those crimes matter and the police department knows it.'&nbsp;</p><p>Not enforcing such rules 'encourages people to be scofflaws,' Stimson added in his comment to Fox News Digital.&nbsp;</p><p>'Now you see what's happening. It's like a dystopian sort of one of the Batman movies where the Jokers are running the city,' Stimson said. 'Because they don't feel like they even have to do anything, follow any of the rules. And so it … is a sense of lawlessness because the laws don't matter.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/major-cities-violent-crimes-data-murders-shootings' target='_blank'><strong>DEFUND THE POLICE MOVEMENT STILL HURTING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES</strong></a></p><p>Violent crimes spiked in 2020 amid the defund and BLM movements and as COVID upended society in unprecedented ways, most notably with murders increasing nearly 30% compared to 2019, FBI data show.

He added later that 'the people who are most impacted when police pull back and stop enforcing crimes as aggressively as they have been in the past … it's often the people that these policies are supposed to help: minority members of that community.'</p><p>Smith argued that people living in poorer communities who bear the brunt of violent crimes benefit the most when police officers are 'empowered to do their jobs and force the laws on their books, investigate crimes and make arrests.'</p> <!---->"

'We're going to look at everything that's been said, determine which of those comments are legally actionable and proceed from there.'</p><p>McMurtry said it’s '​​pretty much assured that there's probably 10 to 15 solid' cases against 'large defendants.'&nbsp;</p><p>Rittenhouse was charged with two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide,&nbsp;and other charges after fatally shooting two men and injuring another during the Kenosha riots of 2020.

The designation resulted in Rittenhouse’s social media accounts being pulled down and restricting positive comments about the teenager.&nbsp;</p><p>'Let's just use for an example what Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg said about [Rittenhouse]. They said that he was involved in a mass murder incident,' McMurtry explained. 'This was not a mass murder incident.

And then to use the power of social media to basically … censor any views that would take opposition to that mass murderer statement is a serious effort to destroy his character. And it was seriously mistaken and seriously defamatory.'</p><p>Outrage erupted after Facebook and Instagram designated <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests' target='_blank'>the shooting during the Kenoohsa riot</a> a 'mass murder incident' before a trial or verdict, with the Wall Street Journal's editorial board arguing in 2020 that such a designation hurt the teenager's shot at due process and called the move an 'alarming resort to censorship.'&nbsp;</p><p>Meta, Facebook's parent company, ultimately reinstated Rittenhouse's social media accounts after his acquittal last year and lifted other restrictions.&nbsp;</p><p>McMurtry added that<a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mark-zuckerberg' target='_blank'> Zuckerberg is 'certainly going to be at the top</a> of your list' when examining what potentially false statements are legally actionable 'because he has an outsized voice.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/media/kyle-rittenhouse-media-accountability-project' target='_blank'><strong>KYLE RITTENHOUSE LAUNCHING INITIATIVE TO COMBAT 'LIES' FROM POWERFUL MEDIA OUTLETS, NAMES THOSE HE MAY SUE</strong></a></p><p>'Facebook has an outsized voice, they can do a lot of damage, as compared to somebody maybe who has a small blog with 100 subscribers.

'She called me a ‘murderer’ after I was acquitted by a jury of my peers. She went on to still say that.'&nbsp;</p><p>As for proving damages, McMurtry told Fox News Digital he knows 'for a fact that [Rittenhouse] can prove that his job prospects are permanently diminished.'&nbsp;</p><p>'Not to mention what they call perpetual reputational harm, which means that Kyle is never going to have an interaction with anybody where they don't know who he is. And this is going to follow him around for the rest of his life.'</p><p>'Everybody's going to prejudge him in every new interaction that he has with everybody for the rest of his life, and that's called perpetual reputational harm. … The social media hysteria caused all this because people can't act reasonably and rationally in certain circumstances,' McMurtry said.&nbsp;</p> <!---->"

And even after they commit a crime, some new district attorneys have chosen not to prosecute certain misdemeanors or to eliminate cash bail. Chiefs expressed particular concern over juveniles who commit violent crimes but avoid prosecution as a result of these new policies, saying young people feel emboldened when they commit a crime and successfully get away with it.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/seattle-police-stopped-investigating-new-adult-sexual-assaults' target='_blank'><strong><u>SEATTLE POLICE MEMO SHOWS DEFUNDED FORCE STOPPED INVESTIGATING NEW ADULT SEXUAL ASSAULTS THIS YEAR</u></strong></a></p><p>NYPD Chief Kenneth Corey noted that 78% of those arrested for nonfatal shootings are currently walking the streets of New York City.</p><p>Harrison said he feels like he needs to retrain his entire department a moment’s notice when these new policies are put in place without adequate communication between sectors of the criminal justice system, adding that while prosecutorial policies may change, laws stay the same.

'And I think this is how we all come together to lean on each other and draw from each other's expertise, each other's experiences.'</p><h3><strong>Staffing shortages</strong></h3><p>Police departments in major cities are short-staffed and having trouble recruiting new officers and retaining those who already work for them. They want more funding — not less — to address both staffing and society’s concerns about transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>'Everybody is sort of dealing with the same issue,' Harrison said, 'And so there's no one solution to it, but meetings like this make us come together to work to improve the profession so that people would want to join and people will want to come and make a difference, whether it's in my town or in any other part of the country.'</p><p>Departments in cities across the U.S. are losing officers to suburban police departments. Several cities are incentivizing new recruits with signing bonuses. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed $20,000 signing bonuses for nearly 350 new officers as part of her 2023 budget, D.C. Chief Robert Contee said.</p><p>'It's about changing how people view our profession,' Harrison said, 'so that, number one, we can really spark an interest in policing and then delivering police services. In serving and protecting and getting back to just…being the noble profession that we know we can be' so that potential recruits want to join police departments.</p> <!---->"

The winning word, according to Scripps, was 'moorhen,' which means the female of the red grouse, because that was the one that moved her past Vikram.</p><p>Over the past couple months, the ever-prepared Harini had practiced for the possibility of a lightning round, a format she found uncomfortable.</p><p>'When it got introduced last year, I was a bit terrified, to be honest,' Harini said. 'I go slow. That’s my thing. I didn’t know how I would fare in that setting.'</p><p>Harini, a crowd favorite for her poise and positivity, wins more than $50,000 in cash and prizes. She is the first-ever Scripps champion to be reinstated during the competition. And that was before her four late stumbles.</p><p>'I think it would have been really easy for me to get deterred, to get sort of like, ‘Wow, why am I missing so much?’' Harini said. 'Really just focusing on the next word and knowing that I’m still in, I think was just a big relief for me.'</p><p>She is the fifth Scripps champion to be coached by Walters, a former speller, fellow Texan and student at Rice University who is considering bowing out of the coaching business.

Scripps said the correct answer was the swarming of bees. Her supporters made the case to the judges that she’d gotten it right. A few minutes later, head judge Mary Brooks announced the reversal.</p><p>'We did a little sleuthing after you finished, which is what our job is, to make sure we’ve made the right decision,' Brooks said.

Investigators haven’t commented on what information officials tried to relay to law enforcement inside the school.</p><p>The local police radio system, which serves a nine-county area in this stretch of <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas' target='_blank'>rural South Texas</a>, was built in the early 2000s after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when emergency response was priortized nationwide, according to Mr. Anderson.</p><p>Mr. Anderson said higher-frequency radios used in urban areas, which can better penetrate buildings, cannot cover the vast geography of an area like South Texas. He said he and other system designers assumed officers inside buildings could step outside when they needed to communicate. 'The thought just wasn’t there that it would ever be an issue,' he said.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/uvalde-texas-school-shooting' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: LIVE UPDATES</u></strong></a></p><div source='Getty Images' class='image-ct inline'><div class='m'><picture><source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1470/828/Uvalde-school-shooting-law-enforcement.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'><source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1862/1048/Uvalde-school-shooting-law-enforcement.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'> <img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/640/320/Uvalde-school-shooting-law-enforcement.png?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Law enforcement work the scene after a mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, May 25.'></picture></div> </div><p>Visiting law enforcement from areas elsewhere in Texas can tap into the Uvalde-area communications, but federal agencies such as Border Patrol use an entirely different radio system, Mr. Anderson said.

'You know, whether people want to aim high or fly Navy, we just want them to get excited about serving the nation in some capacity.'</p><p>The military has faced recruiting challenges over the past few years, with the coronavirus pandemic reportedly causing shortages that led to each branch missing reserve attainment targets even with lower targets in those years.

The new film, which was released over Memorial Day weekend, and <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/top-gun-maverick-memorial-day-box-office-tom-cruise-movie' target='_blank'>gave Cruise his first $100 million opening weekend</a> for a film, raking in an impressive $321 million global total.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/top-gun-maverick-pirates-caribbean-record-box-office-numbers' target='_blank'><strong>‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ BEATS OUT THIRD INSTALLMENT OF ‘PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN’ IN BOX OFFICE NUMBERS</strong></a></p><p>The military looked to capitalize on the high buzz and impressive reviews – sitting at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with over 360 reviews – by running a recruitment ad before the movie. Thomas said that the service had 'a lot of fun' making the ad, which he called a 'high-speed, adrenaline-pumping aviation air power commercial.'&nbsp;</p><div class='embed-media youtube' data-v-5a001baa=''><div class='video-container' data-v-5a001baa=''><iframe src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LbNP0FUItjI' width='720' height='405' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' data-v-5a001baa=''></iframe></div></div><p>'This commercial has it all,' Thomas said.

The crew flew in real planes that <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/top-gun-studio-fighter-jets-11k-hour-tom-cruise' target='_blank'>cost the production more than $11,000 an hour</a> to rent, but only military-trained pilots could handle the jets.&nbsp;</p><p>Paramount Pictures said in the movie's production notes that Cruise established his own flight training program to prepare the film's young actors for the nausea-inducing rigors of plane maneuvers, and so they could perform their roles with 'real Navy pilots taking them on the ride of their lives.'</p><p><i>Fox News Landon Mion contributed to this report.&nbsp;</i></p> <!---->"

They rejected plea deals from prosecutors earlier.</p><p>Minnesota court rules normally bar audio and video coverage of a criminal trial unless all parties consent and the defense in this case has objected. Cahill made an exception for Chauvin’s trial to ensure safe public and media access amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and it drew worldwide viewership. But he ruled in April that the pandemic had abated to the point that he’s bound by normal court rules.</p><p>A special advisory committee that's been studying those rules is due to deliver a nonbinding report next month to the Minnesota Supreme Court. There's no deadline for a final decision, but the delay in the trial revives the possibility that the proceedings for Thao and Kueng could be livestreamed.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson has not set dates for sentencing Chauvin, Thao, Kueng and Lane on their federal civil rights convictions. Defense attorneys said during a hearing before Cahill last week that they were expecting the sentencings sometime in September. Chauvin pleaded guilty to a civil rights charge in December, while the other three went to trial.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.&nbsp;</i></p> <!----> <div class='article-meta'><div class='author-bio'><p>Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

Gen. Edward W. Thomas Jr., commander of the Air Force Recruiting Service, told Fox News Digital. 'You know, this is a recruiting market right now. There are good opportunities to serve and good incentives to do so.'</p><p>The military faced a drop-off in recruitment during the pandemic: Each branch met active component goals, but reserve numbers have fallen short each year. That shortage has now hit the Active component goals for the Army and Navy, with other branches just meeting their goals.&nbsp;</p><p>One significant factor that Thomas highlighted is the lack of engagement the military could pursue while schools remained remote in 2020 during nationwide lockdowns: A <a href='https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/g/ge/geographic-diversity-in-military-recruiting/d-9079.ashx' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>2018 report by the Institute for Defense Analyses </a>heavily focused on recruitment at the high school level, indicating the high value placed on that pipeline.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-ukraine-weapons-package-us-military-defense' target='_blank'><strong>NAVY VETERAN SAYS NEW BILL WOULD ‘RIGHT THE WRONGS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES’</strong></a></p><p>'Really in the long term … it's declining eligibility, declining propensity or interest in serving and declining trust in government,' Thomas said.&nbsp;</p><p>'Today, 77% of American youth aged 17 to 24 will not qualify to serve the United States military without a waiver, 77%,' he continued. 'That's based on a variety of different reasons, from weight to medical issues to academic issues to behavioral issues, mental health issues. It's a wide variety with 77% don't qualify without a waiver.'</p><p>And Thomas admitted that the perception around <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administrations-afghanistan-withdrawal-caused-major-frustration-across-us-military-army-report-reveals' target='_blank'>the military withdrawal from Afghanistan</a> may have impacted recruitment in the last six months, but stressed that he would not consider it 'one of the primary drivers.'&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-ambassador-praises-japanese-pm-kishida-defense-spending' target='_blank'><strong>US AMBASSADOR PRAISES JAPANESE PM KISHIDA FOR HIKING SELF-DEFENSE INVESTMENTS</strong></a></p><p>The drop-off forced the military to reduce their goals, which they were able to do thanks to higher-than-usual retention.</p><p>'Back in 2020 and '21, we did reduce our recruiting goals slightly because retention was high,' Thomas said. 'We have not seen that in wanting to.'</p><p>'What we saw when COVID hit, we had record high retention in the Air Force and I believe across the body,' Thomas explained.

With the nation facing its <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/unemployment-hits-49-year-low-as-us-employers-step-up-hiring' target='_blank'>highest level of employment in 50 years</a>, the military faces 'fierce' competition with the general job market. The rate of unemployment spiked early in the pandemic but has since then returned to around 3.5%</p><p>'It's good for the nation in general,' he said. 'It makes the battle for talent all that much more ferocious.'&nbsp;</p><p>To try and compete with that healthy market, the military has offered larger-than-usual bonuses, <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/army-ups-bonuses-recruits-50k-covid-takes-toll' target='_blank'>including up to $50,000 for certain fields</a>, such as special warfare. Other fields for 'hard to fill jobs' have incentives ranging from $3000 to $6000. The main goal is to keep trying to attract the best of the best, including varsity athletes, candidates with multiple language proficiency or candidates with expertise in niche fields including crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the problem may be due to the lack of understanding when it comes to the kinds of roles available in the military. In just the Air Force alone, Thomas noted that there are 'about 130 enlisted career fields.'&nbsp;</p><p>'Almost anything you can do in a major city, maybe other than being a stockbroker, you know, or a few select jobs you can pretty much do in the Air Force,' he explained. 'So all of the peripherals that we recruit for, we're recruiting for medical, for radiology technicians, for dental technicians … you name it.'&nbsp;</p><div><a href='http://test.skimlinks.com'>Skimlinks Test</a></div> <!----> <div class='article-meta'><div class='author-bio'><p>Peter Aitken is a Fox News Digital reporter with a focus on national and global news.&nbsp;</p></div></div>"
