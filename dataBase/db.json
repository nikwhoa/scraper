He doesn't care what a student's GPA is or if their family has a criminal history.&nbsp;</p><p>'[There are] enough barriers and obstacles put up against these folks,' Kadens said.

The demand for 'pandemic puppies' has fallen, as people return to work. One possible solution is fostering.</p><p>'All shelters across the country need your help. And one of the biggest ways you can help is by fostering,' said Melissa Knicely, a spokesperson for Charlotte Animal Care and Control.</p><p>Right now there’s no shortage of bigger breeds at Knicely’s shelter. Its dog kennels are at 100% capacity, and they have not dropped below 85% capacity in the past year, which is considered a critical capacity. She says, ideally, their cages would be about half full.</p><p>'It is stressful. You hear all the barking? It’s stressful. You get these animals into a home. They get comfortable. You start knowing their personalities,' she said.</p><p>Knicely says that's why fostering is catching on more at shelters. She says about half of the people who foster a dog end up adopting them. And even if they don’t adopt, fostering can help the shelter understand how a dog behaves around families or other pets for an extended period.</p><p>'We have so much information to share to find the right home for that dog,' Knicely said.&nbsp;</p><p>'Staffing has been an issue from the start of the pandemic, as you can imagine. That's why it’s so important to have people step up and volunteer and foster,' said Kitty Block, the President and CEO of the Humane society of the United States.</p><p>The Humane Society says an overabundance of dogs isn't the only problem for some shelters — staffing is too. Right now Charlotte Animal Care and Control could hire 13 people on the spot, but finding people to hire is a struggle, Knicely said.</p><p>As far as adopting a dog goes, the Humane Society says some people are being priced out because of inflation.</p><p>'It’s very hard to find affordable housing that allows pets,' Block said.</p><p>You can foster a dog for anywhere from one day to several months depending on the organization and the needs of the dog. And sometimes fostering a dog can leave space at the shelter for animals who need special care or management.</p><p>'When you foster one animal, you’re really saving two. Because you’re saving the animal that you’re fostering, and you’re making room for the next animal that needs that spot at the shelter,' Knicely said.</p><p>Knicely says that cats are being adopted at a much quicker rate. Possibly because they fit more easily into people’s busy schedules.</p> <!---->"

      "description": "<p class='speakable'>A scientific analysis commissioned by the FBI shortly before agents went digging for buried treasure suggested that a huge quantity of gold could be below the surface, according to newly released government documents and photos that deepen the mystery of the 2018 excavation in remote western <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania' target='_blank'>Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p class='speakable'>The report, by a geophysicist who performed microgravity testing at the site, hinted at an underground object with a mass of up to 9 tons and a density consistent with gold. The FBI used the consultant’s work to obtain a warrant to seize the gold — if there was any to be found.</p><p>The government has long claimed its dig was a bust. But a father-son pair of treasure hunters who spent years hunting for the fabled Civil War-era gold — and who led agents to the woodland site, hoping for a finder’s fee — suspect the FBI double-crossed them and made off with a cache that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>The newly revealed geophysical survey was part of a court-ordered release of government records on the FBI’s treasure hunt at Dent’s Run, about 135 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, where legend says an 1863 shipment of Union gold was either lost or stolen on its way to the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/philadelphia' target='_blank'>U.S. Mint in Philadelphia</a>.</p><div source='Associated Press' class='image-ct inline'><div class='m'><picture><source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1470/828/16fc9832-1000-10.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'><source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1862/1048/16fc9832-1000-10.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'> <img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/640/320/16fc9832-1000-10.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Dennis Parada, right, and his son Kem Parada stand at the site of the FBI's dig for Civil War-era gold in Sept, 2018, in Dents Run, Pennsylvania.'></picture></div> </div><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/treasure-hunters-sue-civil-war-gold-dig' target='_blank'><strong>FLASHBACK: PENNSYLVANIA TREASURE HUNTERS SUE FOR RECORDS ON FBI'S CIVIL WAR-ERA GOLD DIG</strong></a></p><p>Dennis and Kem Parada, who co-own the treasure-hunting outfit Finders Keepers, successfully <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department' target='_blank'>sued the Justice Department</a> for the records after being stonewalled by the FBI. Finders Keepers provided the FBI records to The Associated Press. The FBI subsequently posted them on its website.</p><p>The technical survey data collected by geophysical consulting firm Enviroscan gave credence to the treasure hunters’ own extensive fieldwork at the site — and prompted the FBI to excavate in a massive, secretive operation that lasted for several frigid days in late winter of 2018.</p><p>John Louie, a geophysics professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, unconnected to the dig, reviewed Enviroscan’s report at the request of the AP and said the firm’s 'methods were very good,' and 'their conclusions represent a physically reasonable hypothesis' that gold was buried at the site.</p><p>But he cautioned the subsurface gravity anomaly that Enviroscan identified did not definitively establish the presence of gold. There are other technical reasons why Enviroscan’s data could have turned out the way it did, Louie said.</p><p>'Thus, it is also entirely reasonable that the FBI did not find anything at the site, because there was not really any gold there,' he said via email.</p><p>Enviroscan co-founder Tim Bechtel declined to comment about his work at Dent’s Run, saying the FBI has not given him permission to talk. The FBI would not discuss Bechtel this week but said that after the dig, agents 'did not take any subsequent steps to reconcile the geophysical-survey findings with the absence of gold or any other metal.'</p><p>Other documents in the just-released FBI case file raise still more questions.</p><p>A one-paragraph FBI report, dated March 13, 2019 — exactly one year after the dig — asserted agents found nothing at Dent’s Run. No 'metals, items, and/or other relevant materials were found,' the report said.

'If that is the official record in the file of what they did and why they did it, it says almost nothing, and it’s crazy.'</p><p>She added that if the government does not produce a fuller, more contemporaneous accounting of its search for the gold, it 'will heighten my view that this is not an accurate record and this was created as a cover-up. And I don’t say that lightly.'</p><p>In response, the FBI said the single-page document 'is representative of the standard summaries filed when formally closing an FBI investigation.'</p><p>The agency has consistently denied it found anything.</p><p>Agents acted on information that Dent’s Run 'may have been a cultural heritage site containing gold belonging to the United States government,' the FBI said in a statement, but 'that possibility was not borne out by the excavation. The FBI continues to unequivocally reject any claims or speculation to the contrary.'</p><p>The trove of documents turned over to Finders Keepers also included nearly 1,000 photos, in grainy black-and-white, that show some — but certainly not all — of what the FBI was doing at the dig site, according to the treasure hunters.</p><p>Residents have previously told of hearing a backhoe and jackhammer overnight between the first and second days of the dig — when the work was supposed to have been paused — and seeing a convoy of FBI vehicles, including large armored trucks.</p><div videoid='5846570439001' videodomain='foxnews' class='related video-ct'><div class='m'><a href='http://video.foxnews.com/v/5846570439001' target='_blank'><img src='https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/10/09/694940094001_5846570387001_5846570439001-vs.jpg' alt='Treasure hunters: FBI acting suspiciously over Civil War-era gold '> <span class='overlay'></span></a></div> </div><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-goodwill-ancient-roman-bust' target='_blank'><strong>GOODWILL FIND IN TEXAS TURNS OUT TO BE ANCIENT ROMAN BUST</strong></a></p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi' target='_blank'>The FBI </a>denied any work took place at the site after hours, saying the 'only nighttime activity was ATV patrols by FBI Police personnel, who secured the site around the clock for the duration of the excavation.'</p><p>Parada suspects the FBI retrieved the gold in the middle of the night and then showed the treasure hunters an empty hole on the afternoon of the second day.</p><p>'It’s very curious why the FBI is going to such an extent to misdirect and be so obstructionist on this,' said Warren Getler, who has worked closely with the treasure hunters. 'They worked that night under cover of darkness to evade, escape our knowledge of something we’re supposed to be partners in.'</p><p>Many of the FBI photos are seemingly irrelevant, including the hundreds of images of random trees and a woodland road leading to the dig site, while others simply don’t add up or raise additional questions, assert Parada and Getler, author of 'Rebel Gold,' a book exploring the possibility of buried Civil War-era caches of gold and silver.</p><p>FBI agents are shown standing around the hole in photos that appear earlier in the series, but they are absent from nearly all of the later images at the dig site.</p><p>Getler and Parada say the lead FBI agent told them the hole was filled with water the morning of the second day, but the low-quality images released by the government show only a small puddle or perhaps a bit of snow. They said that same agent spent most of the second day at base camp — where Getler and the treasure hunters say they were largely confined to their car — and not at the dig site.</p><p>The FBI said it’s standard for photos to 'document site conditions before, during, and after FBI operations,' Parada claims it all points to a clandestine overnight dig and a second-day excavation that was just for show.</p><p>'I think we were expecting a couple hundred photos of the night dig, and I think we were expecting pictures of metal coins or bars,' Parada said. 'I think there were pictures, but they disappeared.'</p><p>The FBI records also show that several weeks before the excavation, an agent with the agency’s art crime team approached Wells Fargo to ask whether it shipped gold by stagecoach for the U.S. Mint in 1863.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history' target='_blank'>Wells Fargo historians</a> turned up no evidence of it but said records from the era are incomplete. Wells Fargo did ship gold by stagecoach, a corporate archivist wrote in an email to the FBI, but large quantities of the precious metal, as well as gold that had to be carried long distances, were 'better transported by ship or train.'</p><p>Getler said the gold might have been transported by wagon, not stagecoach.</p><p>Additional FBI releases are expected over the coming months.</p> <!---->"

'There is no doubt about the intent of these suspects when the messages and images they sent are reviewed.'&nbsp;</p><p>'That’s why it’s important for parents to know who their children are communicating with online because sexual predators are looking for opportunities to exploit them,' the sheriff added.

'That includes cyber criminals holding data for ransom and nation-states like China stealing defense and industrial secrets and lately, that's included Russia trying to influence what happens in the ground war.'</p><p>Wray spoke at the Boston Conference on Cybersecurity, outlining the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-evolving-intelligence-suggesting-possible-russian-cyberattacks-against-us' target='_blank'>various threats to American citizens and infrastructure</a> that rogue operators and rival states pose.&nbsp;</p><p>'We've got a 24/7 Cyber Command post running, and we've been pushing out intelligence products and technical indicators, not just to government partners, but also to private companies and others,' Wray explained.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-cybercapabilities-quantum-computing-answer' target='_blank'><strong>RUSSIA SHOWN ONLY SOME CYBERCAPABILITIES, BUT US HAS QUANTUM COMPUTING ANSWER TO POSSIBLE THREATS</strong></a></p><p>The director outlined how these rival states look to utilize cyber warfare in times of conflict and against civilian targets: He discussed how ransomware 'gangs,' often state-sponsored, will attack everything from <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/colonial-pipeline-goes-back-online-after-cyberattack-forced-shutdown' target='_blank'>oil and gas pipelines</a> to schools and local governments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wray claimed that in 2021 the FBI recorded ransomware attacks 'against 14 of the 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors,' which includes health care and 'a lot of other things we depend on.'&nbsp;</p><p>'Last May, for example, the FBI’s cyber team here in Boston uncovered important indicators of compromise for the Avadon ransomware strain,' Wray said. 'Avadon was one of the most prolific ransomware variants in the world at the time. Our folks quickly published what they found to warn the public.'&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-police-use-of-force-public-distrust' target='_blank'><strong>FBI RELEASES NEW DETAILS ON POLICE USE OF FORCE AS PUBLIC GRAPPLES WITH DISTRUST</strong></a></p><p>'Just two days after that, a local police department out in the Southwest told FBI Boston that they'd seen some of those indicators of compromise,' he continued. 'The police department was able to use our Boston division's information to stop Avadon from infecting their network. So that's our folks here helping out a city clear on the other side of the country.'</p><p>Another such example included an attack from Iran-backed hackers who in 2001 tried to attack Boston Children’s Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>'We got a report from one of our intelligence partners indicating Boston Children's was about to be targeted and understanding the urgency of the situation, the cyber squad in our Boston field office raced out to notify the hospital,' Wray revealed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-offers-10-million-reward-russian-hackers' target='_blank'><strong>STATE DEPARTMENT OFFERS $10 MILLION REWARD IN SEARCH FOR RUSSIAN HACKERS</strong></a></p><p>'It's a great example of why we deploy in the field the way we do, enabling that kind of immediately before the catastrophe strikes response,' he added. 'Unfortunately, hospitals these days and a lot of other providers of critical infrastructure have even more to worry about than Iranian government hackers.'&nbsp;</p><p>The key to fending off <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cybercrime' target='_blank'>ransomware and foreign state attacks</a> will rest in creating a 'continuous' flow of information between state and private entities in the U.S. to ensure that any new information can reach the most critical areas before those vulnerabilities can be exploited.&nbsp;</p><p>'What we need to do is kick off a virtuous cycle that feeds on itself where we use the information from one company that gives us to develop information about whom the adversary is, what they're doing, where, why, how taking pains to protect that company's identity, just as we do with other sources we have,' Wray argued.&nbsp;</p><p>'And then when we pass what we develop to our partners here, and abroad, our fellow U.S. and foreign intelligence services, foreign law enforcement, a sector, risk management agencies, providers like Microsoft.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <!---->"

Why are they going to waste their limited time and resources arresting or investigating crimes that they know that the district attorney has said he or she is going to prosecute? … It leads to under-enforcement of crime overall,' Smith continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Former Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Joe Sullivan added in an interview with Fox News Digital that laws restricting who officers pull over or not prosecuting crimes such as shoplifting are 'absolutely' adding to the crime spike of 2022, describing it as 'normalizing deviancy.'&nbsp;</p><p>'We're sending a message that … you don't have to obey the law. You don't have to obey police officers. You can pretty much do as you want. And as we head into the warmer weather, I think we're already having some serious consequences,' Sullivan said, citing Chicago's recent curfew announcement for minors to help curb crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Traffic stops are the most common interaction police have with the public, with officers nationwide making roughly 50,000 traffic stops per day, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project. Fox News Digital also spoke with the Heritage Foundation’s senior legal fellow Cully Stimson, who pointed to a recent 'Rogue Prosecutor Symposium' held by the think tank where experts discussed how stops for low-level infractions can often lead to the apprehension of a person who is connected to other more serious crimes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/murders-rose-study-2021' target='_blank'><strong><u>MURDERS ROSE 5% IN 2021 COMPARED TO 2020; 44% COMPARED TO 2019: STUDY</u></strong></a></p><p>'If you find people, and you pull them over for a minor traffic infraction and then you find they have a warrant [or] you find out somebody in the car with him has a warrant. And so you want people to enforce the law because by enforcing the law, you end up stumbling into other situations where people have open warrants,' he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Stimson and Smith both explained that something as seemingly innocuous as not cracking down on turnstile jumping can embolden criminals. Former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue was among the experts who spoke at Heritage’s 'Rogue Prosecutor Symposium' and argued that prosecuting quality of life crimes - like turnstile jumping or low-level drug offenses -&nbsp;is 'incredibly important.'</p><p>'A lot of cases, significant cases, in New York City history have been made … starting with a turnstile jumping case, right? Because the guy who jumps the turnstile has a gun and the gun is linked to a murder and so on and so forth,' Donoghue said at the symposium. 'And so those crimes matter. Enforcement of those crimes matter and the police department knows it.'&nbsp;</p><p>Not enforcing such rules 'encourages people to be scofflaws,' Stimson added in his comment to Fox News Digital.&nbsp;</p><p>'Now you see what's happening. It's like a dystopian sort of one of the Batman movies where the Jokers are running the city,' Stimson said. 'Because they don't feel like they even have to do anything, follow any of the rules. And so it … is a sense of lawlessness because the laws don't matter.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/major-cities-violent-crimes-data-murders-shootings' target='_blank'><strong>DEFUND THE POLICE MOVEMENT STILL HURTING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES</strong></a></p><p>Violent crimes spiked in 2020 amid the defund and BLM movements and as COVID upended society in unprecedented ways, most notably with murders increasing nearly 30% compared to 2019, FBI data show.

He added later that 'the people who are most impacted when police pull back and stop enforcing crimes as aggressively as they have been in the past … it's often the people that these policies are supposed to help: minority members of that community.'</p><p>Smith argued that people living in poorer communities who bear the brunt of violent crimes benefit the most when police officers are 'empowered to do their jobs and force the laws on their books, investigate crimes and make arrests.'</p> <!---->"
