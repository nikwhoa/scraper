We have the most diverse population with various races, religions and ethnicities.&nbsp;</li><li>First Amendment. <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment' target='_blank'>We have a First Amendment</a> that not only provides freedom of speech (as many other nations do), but protects religious freedom and freedom of the press. As far as that free speech, Americans are among the world's most supportive citizens with regard to free speech – even if it criticizes the government or supports an unpopular opinion – freedom of the press, and the right to use the internet without government censorship. Unlike other countries, in the U.S. freedom of speech includes the right to engage in symbolic speech, to use certain offensive words and phrases to convey political messages, and to advertise commercial products and professional services. It also gives us the right to not speak, specifically the right to not salute the flag if one so desires. Americans are also more tolerant of offensive speech than people in most other nations despite what you might think after reading social media.</li><li>We lead the world in aerospace&nbsp;and aviation.</li><li>If you desire to be an entrepreneur, it is very easy to start a business in the United States, the land of opportunity, compared with other countries.</li><li>Our passports have far&nbsp;fewer restrictions when traveling the world than most other nations.</li><li>We are an extremely educated nation, with nearly 46% of our population obtaining higher education.</li><li>We have access to food and clean drinking water.</li><li>We are one of the world leaders in medical innovation and the world’s top&nbsp;three hospitals – the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital -- are in the United States.</li><li>We have the strongest military power in the world.</li></ul><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters' target='_blank'><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>I could go on.

For example, we must respect the 'wall of separation between the church and state,' as Thomas Jefferson described the adoption of&nbsp;the establishment clause, and resist becoming an extremist or fascist nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Our democracy is truly in danger with recent Supreme Court rulings and potential future decisions,&nbsp;such as SCOTUS reviewing state legislatures’ power in federal elections and possibly giving them the right to ignore federal election results and determine the winners themselves. That would be very dangerous in a nation where some still believe the 'stolen election' lie.

'Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.'</p><p>The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather' target='_blank'>demand of a hot summer</a>.</p><p>Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.</p><p>That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-power-grid-operator-residents-conserve-energy-plants-go-offline' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.</p><p>Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.</p><p>'A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,' SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative <a href='https://www.wsiltv.com/townnews/commerce/letter-from-il-power-company-warns-customers-of-potential-rolling-blackouts-this-summer/article_b41e699e-f26c-11ec-b118-736308d80b1f.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>said in the letter</a>. 'In the event that this happens, your Cooperative would be directed to disconnect a portion of the load in order to prevent an electric grid failure.'</p><p>Critics have blamed the potential shortages on Illinois Gov.

'And you can measure that on multiple levels of success, in terms of what they’ve actually purported to or claim that they would produce in terms of electricity, reliability, cost. In terms of actual construction, or cost to the consumers.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan' target='_blank'>Grid operators in Michigan</a> have also been bracing for the possibility of blackouts this summer, with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's seasonal assessment finding 'capacity shortfalls in both the north and central regions of MISO… leaving those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages to preserve the integrity of the bulk electric system,' JT Smith, the MISO executive director, told NPR last month.</p><p>Michigan has been one of the states pushing to switch over to renewable energy sources while simultaneously taking traditional plants offline, with the Michigan Public Service Commission currently considering taking two more plants offline in the near future.</p><p>'Michigan is going down the same route that before it, New Mexico has gone, California has gone,' Turner said.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/grid-operators-warn-electricity-shortage-renewables' target='_blank'><strong><u>GRID OPERATORS WARN OF ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE AMID SWITCH TO RENEWABLES: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Electric companies in the state have resorted to calls for action, taking to social media to urge their customers to demand the state keep the plants online.</p><p>'We need your help to keep the lights on in Michigan this summer and beyond,' Thumb Electric Cooperative General Manager Dallas Braun said on Facebook Monday.

'Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.'</p><p>The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather' target='_blank'>demand of a hot summer</a>.</p><p>Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.</p><p>That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-power-grid-operator-residents-conserve-energy-plants-go-offline' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.</p><p>Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.</p><p>'A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,' SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative <a href='https://www.wsiltv.com/townnews/commerce/letter-from-il-power-company-warns-customers-of-potential-rolling-blackouts-this-summer/article_b41e699e-f26c-11ec-b118-736308d80b1f.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>said in the letter</a>. 'In the event that this happens, your Cooperative would be directed to disconnect a portion of the load in order to prevent an electric grid failure.'</p><p>Critics have blamed the potential shortages on Illinois Gov.

'And you can measure that on multiple levels of success, in terms of what they’ve actually purported to or claim that they would produce in terms of electricity, reliability, cost. In terms of actual construction, or cost to the consumers.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan' target='_blank'>Grid operators in Michigan</a> have also been bracing for the possibility of blackouts this summer, with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's seasonal assessment finding 'capacity shortfalls in both the north and central regions of MISO… leaving those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages to preserve the integrity of the bulk electric system,' JT Smith, the MISO executive director, told NPR last month.</p><p>Michigan has been one of the states pushing to switch over to renewable energy sources while simultaneously taking traditional plants offline, with the Michigan Public Service Commission currently considering taking two more plants offline in the near future.</p><p>'Michigan is going down the same route that before it, New Mexico has gone, California has gone,' Turner said.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/grid-operators-warn-electricity-shortage-renewables' target='_blank'><strong><u>GRID OPERATORS WARN OF ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE AMID SWITCH TO RENEWABLES: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Electric companies in the state have resorted to calls for action, taking to social media to urge their customers to demand the state keep the plants online.</p><p>'We need your help to keep the lights on in Michigan this summer and beyond,' Thumb Electric Cooperative General Manager Dallas Braun said on Facebook Monday.

'Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.'</p><p>The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather' target='_blank'>demand of a hot summer</a>.</p><p>Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.</p><p>That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-power-grid-operator-residents-conserve-energy-plants-go-offline' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.</p><p>Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.</p><p>'A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,' SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative <a href='https://www.wsiltv.com/townnews/commerce/letter-from-il-power-company-warns-customers-of-potential-rolling-blackouts-this-summer/article_b41e699e-f26c-11ec-b118-736308d80b1f.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>said in the letter</a>. 'In the event that this happens, your Cooperative would be directed to disconnect a portion of the load in order to prevent an electric grid failure.'</p><p>Critics have blamed the potential shortages on Illinois Gov.

'And you can measure that on multiple levels of success, in terms of what they’ve actually purported to or claim that they would produce in terms of electricity, reliability, cost. In terms of actual construction, or cost to the consumers.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan' target='_blank'>Grid operators in Michigan</a> have also been bracing for the possibility of blackouts this summer, with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's seasonal assessment finding 'capacity shortfalls in both the north and central regions of MISO… leaving those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages to preserve the integrity of the bulk electric system,' JT Smith, the MISO executive director, told NPR last month.</p><p>Michigan has been one of the states pushing to switch over to renewable energy sources while simultaneously taking traditional plants offline, with the Michigan Public Service Commission currently considering taking two more plants offline in the near future.</p><p>'Michigan is going down the same route that before it, New Mexico has gone, California has gone,' Turner said.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/grid-operators-warn-electricity-shortage-renewables' target='_blank'><strong><u>GRID OPERATORS WARN OF ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE AMID SWITCH TO RENEWABLES: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Electric companies in the state have resorted to calls for action, taking to social media to urge their customers to demand the state keep the plants online.</p><p>'We need your help to keep the lights on in Michigan this summer and beyond,' Thumb Electric Cooperative General Manager Dallas Braun said on Facebook Monday.

'The extraction and burning of oil, gas, and coal are the primary drivers of climate change, while outdated fossil infrastructure accompanied by wild market volatility have made these fuel sources expensive and unreliable.'&nbsp;</p><p>But Turner argues that there are few rewards for the environment when grids switch over to wind and solar.</p><p>'The notion that they have baptized themselves as green is a joke,' Turner said. 'They use more fossil fuels in the production, installation, and then the redundancies of wind and solar than if they just burn those fossil fuels directly to make electricity.

'Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.'</p><p>The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather' target='_blank'>demand of a hot summer</a>.</p><p>Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.</p><p>That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-power-grid-operator-residents-conserve-energy-plants-go-offline' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.</p><p>Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.</p><p>'A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,' SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative <a href='https://www.wsiltv.com/townnews/commerce/letter-from-il-power-company-warns-customers-of-potential-rolling-blackouts-this-summer/article_b41e699e-f26c-11ec-b118-736308d80b1f.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>said in the letter</a>. 'In the event that this happens, your Cooperative would be directed to disconnect a portion of the load in order to prevent an electric grid failure.'</p><p>Critics have blamed the potential shortages on Illinois Gov.

'And you can measure that on multiple levels of success, in terms of what they’ve actually purported to or claim that they would produce in terms of electricity, reliability, cost. In terms of actual construction, or cost to the consumers.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan' target='_blank'>Grid operators in Michigan</a> have also been bracing for the possibility of blackouts this summer, with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's seasonal assessment finding 'capacity shortfalls in both the north and central regions of MISO… leaving those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages to preserve the integrity of the bulk electric system,' JT Smith, the MISO executive director, told NPR last month.</p><p>Michigan has been one of the states pushing to switch over to renewable energy sources while simultaneously taking traditional plants offline, with the Michigan Public Service Commission currently considering taking two more plants offline in the near future.</p><p>'Michigan is going down the same route that before it, New Mexico has gone, California has gone,' Turner said.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/grid-operators-warn-electricity-shortage-renewables' target='_blank'><strong><u>GRID OPERATORS WARN OF ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE AMID SWITCH TO RENEWABLES: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Electric companies in the state have resorted to calls for action, taking to social media to urge their customers to demand the state keep the plants online.</p><p>'We need your help to keep the lights on in Michigan this summer and beyond,' Thumb Electric Cooperative General Manager Dallas Braun said on Facebook Monday.

'The extraction and burning of oil, gas, and coal are the primary drivers of climate change, while outdated fossil infrastructure accompanied by wild market volatility have made these fuel sources expensive and unreliable.'&nbsp;</p><p>But Turner argues that there are few rewards for the environment when grids switch over to wind and solar.</p><p>'The notion that they have baptized themselves as green is a joke,' Turner said. 'They use more fossil fuels in the production, installation, and then the redundancies of wind and solar than if they just burn those fossil fuels directly to make electricity.

'Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.'</p><p>The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather' target='_blank'>demand of a hot summer</a>.</p><p>Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.</p><p>That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-power-grid-operator-residents-conserve-energy-plants-go-offline' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.</p><p>Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.</p><p>'A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,' SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative <a href='https://www.wsiltv.com/townnews/commerce/letter-from-il-power-company-warns-customers-of-potential-rolling-blackouts-this-summer/article_b41e699e-f26c-11ec-b118-736308d80b1f.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>said in the letter</a>.

'Texas, California, New Mexico, New York, all of New England. These are areas whose policies and political decisions have weakened their electric grid.'</p><p>The potential outages come as many states have moved to quickly take plants that produce traditional sources of energy such as coal and natural gas offline and switch production over to renewable energy sources, which currently do not have the capacity to keep up with the <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather' target='_blank'>demand of a hot summer</a>.</p><p>Part of the issue with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is that it is dependent on variables outside human control, with some areas not having enough wind or sunshine to continuously produce power. Batteries are in development that could help store excess energy production for later use, but the technology is currently expensive and not fully developed.</p><p>That could force grid operators into tough decisions to maintain the integrity of the overall electric grid when demand picks up, but Turner argues that the move to renewable energy is a mistake altogether.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-power-grid-operator-residents-conserve-energy-plants-go-offline' target='_blank'><strong><u>TEXAS POWER GRID OPERATOR URGES RESIDENTS TO CONSERVE ENERGY AS PLANTS GO OFFLINE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Midwest is particularly vulnerable this summer, even though it has for decades been more immune to the rolling blackouts and brownouts that typically plague the West.</p><p>Regulators in Illinois have warned of controlled outages that could occur this summer, with one electric company sending a warning letter to customers during potential heatwaves.</p><p>'A recent generation capacity auction has revealed that the Midwest could fall short of needed generation capacity to serve the summer peak load under certain conditions,' SouthEastern Illinois Electrical Cooperative <a href='https://www.wsiltv.com/townnews/commerce/letter-from-il-power-company-warns-customers-of-potential-rolling-blackouts-this-summer/article_b41e699e-f26c-11ec-b118-736308d80b1f.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>said in the letter</a>. 'In the event that this happens, your Cooperative would be directed to disconnect a portion of the load in order to prevent an electric grid failure.'</p><p>Critics have blamed the potential shortages on Illinois Gov.

'And you can measure that on multiple levels of success, in terms of what they’ve actually purported to or claim that they would produce in terms of electricity, reliability, cost. In terms of actual construction, or cost to the consumers.'</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan' target='_blank'>Grid operators in Michigan</a> have also been bracing for the possibility of blackouts this summer, with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's seasonal assessment finding 'capacity shortfalls in both the north and central regions of MISO… leaving those areas at increased risk of temporary, controlled outages to preserve the integrity of the bulk electric system,' JT Smith, the MISO executive director, told NPR last month.</p><p>Michigan has been one of the states pushing to switch over to renewable energy sources while simultaneously taking traditional plants offline, with the Michigan Public Service Commission currently considering taking two more plants offline in the near future.</p><p>'Michigan is going down the same route that before it, New Mexico has gone, California has gone,' Turner said.</p><p><a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/grid-operators-warn-electricity-shortage-renewables' target='_blank'><strong><u>GRID OPERATORS WARN OF ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE AMID SWITCH TO RENEWABLES: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Electric companies in the state have resorted to calls for action, taking to social media to urge their customers to demand the state keep the plants online.</p><p>'We need your help to keep the lights on in Michigan this summer and beyond,' Thumb Electric Cooperative General Manager Dallas Braun said on Facebook Monday.
