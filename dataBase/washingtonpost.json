So Biden is promising big savings.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But it turns out the White House has been engaging in some inflation of its own.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If that $500 figure appears familiar, it’s because you heard something similar in the president’s <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/' target='_blank'>State of the Union address</a> on March 1. He said his American Rescue Plan would “cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combating climate change.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That figure was a reference to <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf' target='_blank'>a report</a> published in October by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Rhodium predicted that if Biden’s climate change policies were adopted, <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=23' target='_blank'>by 2030</a> “national average annual household energy costs” would be “roughly $500 lower than under current policy.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>First of all, that’s eight years from now — not a lot of help with the current inflation problem, which was the frame of Biden’s op-ed. But the bigger problem is that “national average annual household energy costs” is not the same thing as household utility bills.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://rhg.com/team/john-larsen/' target='_blank'>John Larsen</a>, a Rhodium partner and principal author of the report, said the estimate includes both home energy services and the cost of driving. The two elements are roughly equal in terms of energy costs of $4,163 — $2,126 for mobility and $2,037 for home energy. (Note that the home energy element is similar to the EnergyStar estimate.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But most of the estimated savings, Larsen said, comes from the driving side of the equation. “Of the $495 in savings, $403 comes from mobility savings (spending less money on gasoline either because of more efficient cars or electric vehicles) and the remainder is home energy savings,” he wrote in an email.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Indeed, the report <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=24' target='_blank'>notes</a> that, if the Biden climate plan were adopted, home electricity bills by 2030 would be between one dollar more and five dollars less than under current policy. That might pay for an extra ice cream cone over the summer.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Larsen noted that Biden, in the op-ed, referred to learning this number in a conversation with utility executives, so he did not appear to be referencing the Rhodium report. “I can say that our numbers represent savings across all household energy expenditures and not just those associated with utility bills,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But when we located <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-roundtable-with-ceos-of-electric-utilities-to-discuss-his-build-back-better-agenda/' target='_blank'>the transcript</a> of Biden’s conversation with utility executives on Feb. 9, we found no reference to $500 in utility savings.

They’ve <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-national-divide/2021/09/05/24165092-0b4e-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_41&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>increased the penalties</a> for supposed wrongdoing by election administrators.

Some doubt, for instance, the impact that canvassers can have when it comes to not certifying a vote — given that such canvassers’ jobs are generally ministerial. Even poll workers who raise a fuss about mundane vote-counting issues could see their efforts rebuffed by the courts when push comes to shove, as they were in 2020. It’s possible the 2024 election won’t be close enough for any of this to matter, and that the fever in the GOP surrounding voter fraud could break if, for instance, Trump fades politically.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But one of the lessons of 2020 is that the few Republicans who clearly rebuked Trump’s claim were, not coincidentally, disproportionately those who were <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/08/gop-officials-overwhelmingly-side-against-trumps-voter-fraud-claims-when-forced-decide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>forced to actually take a position by virtue of their official duties</a>. Such people have since been weeded out, often through targeting in GOP primaries, but also through attrition (such as election workers <a href='https://apnews.com/article/election-officials-retire-trump-2020-threats-misinformation-3b810d8b3b3adee2ca409689788b863f' target='_blank'>heading for the exits because of threats</a>); in several cases Republicans have warmed to voter-fraud claims they <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/07/gop-candidates-election-claims/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>never endorsed back in 2020</a>. The pressure has been palpable, and it’s manifested itself in a number of ways that matter, irrespective of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/georgia-texas-primaries-takeaways/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>Raffensperger somehow managing to win renomination</a> last week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The problem with telling that story — of how democracy could be undermined at the grass roots — is that it’s very difficult to get a handle on it in any truly authoritative and quantitative way; it depends so much on the views of people whose views have never been recorded, because nobody outside of a select few even know who they are.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But there is little doubt about what kinds of people will be drawn to these lower-level positions, because we’re seeing what kinds of people are being drawn into running for similar, higher-profile roles.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And the problem could go beyond poll workers raising legally valid complaints or canvassers and secretaries of state refusing to certify results. As we saw in 2020, the simple presence of enough smoke and misinformation was enough to get state and congressional Republicans to seriously consider overriding the vote totals in certain states. The effort to get GOP-run state legislatures to send alternate slates of electors and Congress to reject the results on Jan. 6 was haphazard and didn’t pan out, but we’re in a very different environment even than we were then.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And if enough election truthers are in place to color the process from the grass-roots level up — in a way they failed to in 2020 when the groundwork wasn’t yet laid — it’s not so difficult to see Republicans justifying decisions to themselves that they didn’t in 2020. Because if there’s one thing the Trump era has reinforced, it’s that these things often flow up from the bottom.</p>"

Ennis, as a member of the inspectors general council’s Integrity Committee, must recuse herself from all committee matters while the investigation is ongoing.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Lerner declined to comment on the investigation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the heart of the investigation is the<b> </b>Civil Monetary Penalty Program, a little-known anti-fraud program run by the inspector general’s office. During the Trump administration, under Ennis’s watch, the program began levying unprecedented fines, which reached hundreds of thousands of dollars, on more than 100 people accused of improperly receiving disability benefits. The fines were imposed without considering the age, financial condition or other mitigating factors of the recipients — a departure from how the program had previously operated.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Many of those fined had no hope of ever being able to pay. Over a seven-month period that ended in mid-2019, 83 people were charged a total of $11.5 million, documents obtained by The Post showed — a jump from less than $700,000 for all of 2017.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Civil fines are supposed to provide an alternative when fraud is considered too insignificant to warrant criminal prosecution by the Justice Department. In years past, cases had often settled, with agreements for drastically lower fines as claimants gradually paid back what they owed taxpayers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Thursday, the staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform and Ways and Means committees will summon two of Ennis’s deputies to brief them on how the fines escalated, and about the treatment of two senior officials on Ennis’s staff who raised repeated concerns about the penalties.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Those senior officials were then abruptly placed on administrative leave, with one fired and the other demoted. Both are back at work, one after settling a whistleblower case with the agency. The other, attorney Deborah Shaw, in May was found by an administrative law judge at the Merit Systems Protection Board to have been the victim of “whistleblower reprisal” by Ennis’s office.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Office of Special Counsel, a small independent agency that investigates complaints of retaliation against whistleblowers who report waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, also has opened a case after receiving multiple complaints that employees who work for Ennis have suffered reprisals, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. A spokesman for Special Counsel Henry Kerner declined to comment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Ennis’s chief counsel on Wednesday told the attorneys who work in the civil penalty program to stop issuing fines until further notice while Kijakazi’s staff conducts a thorough review of the program, which was delegated to the inspector general’s office when it started in 1995.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Top House Democrats welcomed the new investigation by CIGIE.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It’s a welcome first step in understanding who has been harmed by the apparent abuses by Social Security’s Office of the Inspector General, and to what extent,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E.

Connolly (D-Va.), who leads the government operations panel on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in a statement that “inspectors general must be pure as driven snow” and said other watchdogs have lingered in their positions for years while the council investigated.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>“</i>Congress is watching, and our oversight Subcommittee is prepared to take appropriate, swift action,” Connolly wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The investigation is likely to be far-reaching. The troubled anti<b>-</b>fraud program is one of several controversies roiling Social Security’s 500-person internal watchdog division, charged with oversight of the agency that distributes retirement benefits to 69 million Americans and monthly disability checks to about 15 million others.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Dozens of senior auditors, law enforcement agents and other staff have quit or retired, many in frustration with what they describe as Ennis’s mercurial leadership and lack of focus on the office’s mission, according to current and former staff members. Ennis has defended her leadership and said some employees bristle at changes when a new leader comes in.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Audits have also plummeted. So has morale, which has taken a nosedive in successive surveys of the federal workforce since Ennis took over. New data for 2021 collected by the Office of Personnel Management for the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) and released internally Tuesday shows 28 percent of those who responded consider the inspector general’s office a good place to work, with 13 percent agreeing that their senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment. And 22 percent said senior leaders maintained high standards of honesty and integrity.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rose, a spokeswoman for Ennis, called the inspector general’s staff “our most valuable resource in accomplishing our mission” and said the office has made efforts to “improve workplace engagement” for several years. “We are analyzing the 2021 FEVS survey results,” she wrote.</p>"

The state Supreme Court in 1989 invalidated a law requiring minors to obtain parental consent to get an abortion based on the provision that states that every “person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into his private life.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The court’s ruling stated that it could “conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning one’s body that one can make in the course of a lifetime.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Florida has some of the least restrictive abortion laws in the southeast.

Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, said the new law is at odds with the “Florida value around privacy, around personal medical decisions, including someone’s pregnancy.

The legislature, they said, passed a law that will “unlawfully intrude upon the fundamental privacy rights of Florida women. It will deny Floridians’ autonomy over their own bodies and undermine their ability to make deeply personal decisions about their lives, families, and health care free of government interference.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a statement Wednesday, the governor’s office said DeSantis is “confident that this law will ultimately withstand all legal challenges.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an antiabortion organization, characterizes to the state’s abortion protections as an “artificial superpowered abortion right,” more expansive than the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Roe </i>and subsequent decisions.

More than enough to make a guy cranky.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But this is not just any guy. It’s Gregg Phillips, the guy who, in D’Souza’s film and at hearings in front of friendly state legislatures, has used intentionally pejorative language to cast his perceived opponents as criminals or dangerous. The people carrying ballots — which, if it occurred, wasn’t even illegal in two of the states True the Vote and D’Souza looked at — are “mules,” as in drug mules. The places where they allegedly collected these ballots (a part of the process left completely unproven in the film) become “stash houses.” All of it, he has declared, showed “organized crime.” It’s not subtle.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>During a hearing before legislators in Arizona on Tuesday, Phillips applied that same tactic to members of the media.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think somebody wrote — the New York Times or someone — wrote, well, you can tell that they’re walking down the street, but you can’t see which side of the street they’re on,” he said. “Utter nonsense. It’s complete nonsense. They’re asking the wrong questions. They’re asking the wrong people.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“These articles are being written by journalistic terrorists,” he added.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Repeat that last line?” a legislator asked — drawing it out for emphasis, as she later made clear.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Yeah,” Phillips said. “The articles are being written by journalistic terrorists, of which I think are probably one or two in this room.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kelli Ward, chair of the Republican Party in the state, liked that phrase.</p><div data-oembed-type='twitter' class='' style='min-height:171px'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>False Information being written and disseminated by “journalistic terrorists” like some of these👇🏼👇🏼 <a href='https://t.co/qTUxmfqQJc'>pic.twitter.com/qTUxmfqQJc</a></p>— Dr. Kelli Ward 🇺🇸 (@kelliwardaz) <a href='https://twitter.com/kelliwardaz/status/1531778377605976064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>May 31, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async='' src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script>\n</div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In addition to retweeting Ward, the state party went further, <a href='https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/media/2022/05/31/arizona-republican-party-media-are-domestic-terrorists-tweet/7463139001/' target='_blank'>declaring</a> that the “mainstream media is Domestic Terrorists.” It later deleted that and another similar tweet.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What’s remarkable about Phillips’s comment isn’t simply how astonishingly over-the-top it was, or even how it made obvious his predilection for exaggerating nefariousness. What’s remarkable is that the new presentation did little to nothing to actually address the valid questions about his purported research. In fact, he made a comment that significantly <i>weakened</i> his case.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At issue is the reliability of his analysis of data collected from cellphones. The idea that thousands of people were ferrying ballots around battleground states depends on the regularity of those phones being in proximity to places with ballot drop boxes. Phillips and his supporters have regularly tried to suggest that people who doubt his analysis are casting doubt on the ability of phones to precisely geolocate someone, which is not the case. But it is the case that there’s good reason to think that Phillips’s analyses don’t include precise measurements of proximity to ballot drop boxes.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Consider what actually determining that someone visited a drop box would require. You’d need a precise measurement of location from the phone and you’d need to know precisely where the drop box was. In other words, you’d need to know that the phone was within a foot or two of a space that itself is only a few square feet. Not only will experts tell you that most cellphone geolocation data is not sufficiently precise, there’s no indication that the True the Vote people even knew where drop boxes were located at the libraries and government offices that hosted them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The best indication we have of what True the Vote was looking at comes from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which in September <a href='https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1451309892824936452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1451309892824936452%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpb.org%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2Fgbi-says-gops-cellphone-data-lacks-enough-evidence-prove-ballot-harvesting' target='_blank'>determined</a> that the data it was provided was insufficient to launch an investigation. The GBI said that the data was “cell site location information” — a triangulated location estimate less accurate than GPS — and that it centered on identifying visits “within 100 feet of a voter drop box.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That’s significantly less precise than Phillips likes to suggest. During his testimony in Arizona, in fact, Phillips insisted that the military could get GPS precision down to a few centimeters. And <a href='https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/#difference' target='_blank'>that’s true</a> — using specific technology that’s not generally available commercially. Using technology that there’s no reason to think he had. Instead, he insisted that by overlapping different bits of data — WiFi access and Bluetooth — he could get more precise. That’s not what the GBI says it received.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At one point, True the Vote’s team showed this map, purporting to show one person’s movements in Yuma County, Ariz.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This is a sample pattern of life for one device in Yuma County from October 7th through November 3rd,” Phillips’s colleague Catherine Engelbrecht said. “This device went to 77 unique drop boxes. And you can see in the lower right where those locations were.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Beyond all of the other questions that naturally arise — like, why bother going to different drop boxes, particularly in less-populated areas? — the data appear to show cellphone pings of someone who lives in Yuma (at top center) and occasionally drives around the region. Do those blue dots correspond to clear visits to libraries? Or more accurately, to visits to drop boxes at those libraries? Not to mention that Yuma County’s 2020 voter guide doesn’t include locations like the Foothills Library (at 13226 S. Frontage Rd. in Yuma) on its <a href='https://www.yumacountyaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=41773' target='_blank'>list of drop-off locations</a>. We’re just meant to take Phillips’s and Engelbrecht’s word for it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That’s what D’Souza did. I <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/discussing-gaps-2000-mules-with-dinesh-dsouza/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>spoke to him</a> about the movie and about Phillips’s data, repeatedly pressing him on questions about credibility. I asked him, for example, how he could be confident that people shown in the movie dropping off ballots were actually “mules,” given that there was no evidence provided for their having gone to more than one drop box. Considering one example of a guy on a bike dropping off a ballot, I pointed out to D’Souza that, beyond Phillips suggesting that the guy was being paid to deposit the ballot, the movie makes no direct claim and offers no evidence that he’s a “mule.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Of course there is a claim being made!” D’Souza insisted. “The context of the movie is to explain that that’s the search criterion. All the mules being counted under that rubric went to 10 or more drop boxes.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Fine. But in Arizona, Phillips made a different claim — to again disparage journalists.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“One of the fallacies in people evaluating and fact-checking the movie,” he said, “really centered around a couple of videos that were out there of people shoving a whole bunch of ballots in.” That would presumably include the guy on the bike, who Phillips claimed (though it’s not apparent in the video) pulls “ballots” out of his backpack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Interestingly, only one of those people actually was a mule,” he continued, “because they didn’t meet the standard of having to get inside 10 times and go to one of the [nonprofit organizations] five times.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>You got that? Fact checks <a href='https://www.ajc.com/politics/what-2000-mules-leaves-out-from-ballot-harvesting-claims/FFMNUU56RVBRNOLZKWHUREQPEU/' target='_blank'>pointing out</a> that the people included in the film “2000 Mules” were not actually mules were flawed because only one of the people shown in the film actually met Phillips’s “mule” standard anyway. (An email to Phillips asking him to identify which person was the mule did not receive a response by the time of publication though he later wrote to say the quote was “out of context.”)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The person shown in the movie before the guy on the bike, incidentally, was a woman who Engelbrecht claimed had visited “dozens and dozens” of drop boxes in both the 2020 presidential election and the Georgia Senate runoff in January 2021. So is she the sole mule? Or was Engelbrecht offering <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/even-geolocation-maps-2000-mules-are-misleading/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45' target='_blank'>another misrepresentation</a> to viewers? And if so, did D’Souza know?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s because of things like this that reporters urge caution in viewing the movie or in taking Phillips’s claims at face value. And it’s because we urge caution that Phillips compares us to people who use violence to evoke fear.</p>"

The toll was higher in 2020, the first year of the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7' target='_blank' class='contextual_link'>coronavirus</a> pandemic. That year was <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/' target='_blank'>the deadliest for gun violence</a> on record.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>While the increase in 2020 was a function of an increase in homicides and accidental shootings, it was still the case that about half of the recorded deaths were suicides.

A few weeks after the election was over, the first reports about that interference emerged, prompting Trump — smarting over having lost the popular vote — to disparage the idea that his victory was a function of anything other than his own aptitude. When BuzzFeed published the dossier of reports compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, Trump’s fury escalated. The Russia allegations were a “WITCH HUNT,” he wrote for the first time that same day. On the day following, he suggested that intelligence agencies had released the document, an act akin to “living in Nazi Germany.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was more than a week before he even became president.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over time, a pattern emerged. Trump would make broad claims about how investigations into Russian interference — and, we later learned, contacts between his campaign team and Russian actors — were contrived to damage him personally. His allies would then scramble to prove him right either in the abstract or to validate the specific claims he had made, however loosely they could.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And over and over and over those efforts to cast Trump as the victim of a plot aimed at undermining his candidacy or his presidency came up short.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Two things bear mentioning at the outset. It is true that the investigation into Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team suffered from flaws and errors. It’s quite possible that no massive investigation could escape some level of error of the sorts exposed by the scrutiny paid to the Russia investigation, but it is true that the scrutiny paid here did reveal questionable actions and decisions that don’t alter our understanding of what occurred.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The other thing worth mentioning is that the details were never the point. Trump’s play from the outset was to raise doubt and then simply refit the evidence as needed. His supporters always champion how he turned out to be “right” about various things, a function of ignoring all the times he was obviously wrong — the kid guessing a number between 1 and 10 who guesses each number and then claims he nailed it. The operating assumption is that Trump is right about being unfairly targeted by the Russia probe and so any new claim that bolsters that assumption is elevated — even after being debunked — until a new, not-yet-debunked claim emerges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What triggered the Russia investigation is simple. Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election both through the much-hyped but less-significant effort to contribute to the social media conversation and through the hacking of the Democratic Party and a top adviser to Hillary Clinton. As this was known to be going on, federal investigators began investigating whether people close to Trump might have been actively working with Russia. People like Paul Manafort, his campaign manager and consultant to Russia-linked actors; and like Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser who had previously been identified as a target for Russian intelligence efforts and who traveled to Moscow in early July 2016; and like George Papadopoulos, another adviser who had been told by a guy who was helping him set up a meeting between Trump and Russia’s president that Russia had some of Clinton’s emails. That Russia had hacked the Democrats was known by mid-June 2016 and the Russia probe was opened by the end of July.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the years since, that simple explanation for the investigation has been muddied by a variety of alternate theories, claims that objective analysis has shown to be either false or irrelevant to the central question.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These are those claims.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One of the first egregious claims Trump made about the Russia investigation was that it involved having the “wires tapped” at Trump Tower during the campaign. This would become a pattern: Trump would take <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/14/why-trump-is-once-again-claiming-that-he-was-spied-upon-2016/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>an overblown claim</a> from conservative media and inflate it further. (There is no evidence that Trump Tower was wiretapped; the government has repeatedly denied that it did so.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Within days, Trump was <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/29/the-nunes-white-house-question-assessed-minute-by-minute/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>claiming</a> that his unfounded assertion was proved right not by evidence of wiretapping but by evidence that communications involving a member of his transition team, Michael Flynn, had been “unmasked” by the administration of Barack Obama. It’s always been odd to try to conflate this with wiretapping Trump Tower unless you recognize the intermediate step: Trump Tower was wiretapped, meaning that Trump was spied on, meaning that anyone working with Trump being spied on validates the claim. This is how it works.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The “Flynn unmasking” argument was clunky, too, because it depended on understanding how surveillance works. The government monitors communications with people like the Russian ambassador. But since the CIA and NSA aren’t supposed to surveil American citizens, the identities of Americans talking to the ambassador are “masked,” which is to say anonymized. Other officials can ask that the identity be unmasked, however, to understand who’s talking to that ambassador in the first place. Which Obama officials did, learning the person talking to Russia’s ambassador was Flynn. (Incidentally, Flynn had visited Moscow in late 2015, sitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696' target='_blank'>at a dinner</a>.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was trumpeted repeatedly as the Obama administration spying on Flynn and, therefore, Trump. But a review from Trump’s own Justice Department later determined that there was <a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'>no evidence</a> that the unmasking was politically motivated. That Flynn later lied to investigators about the conversation, though, led to his pleading guilty to making false statements.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Shortly after the “unmasking” brouhaha, Trump’s irritation about the Russia probe led him to fire FBI Director James B. Comey (though Trump claimed this was about how the FBI handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server). Shortly thereafter, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was assigned to investigate Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team — an assignment made by a Trump appointee aimed at protecting the investigation from interference.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the public sphere, the dossier published by BuzzFeed had attracted outsize attention, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>despite obvious questions</a> about what it alleged. Most media outlets treated it with skepticism or treated it as unconfirmed. As time passed and many of its claims remained unsubstantiated or had been undermined, it gained unexpected importance — among Trump’s <i>defenders</i>. After all, if the dossier could be identified as the primary trigger for the Russia probe and it was contrived, that made the entire investigation dubious.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This line of argument became more appealing after it was learned that Steele had been hired by a firm called Fusion GPS that was itself hired by a law firm working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party. The line of argument skipped a few middle steps to become that Clinton had paid for a dossier of false claims — perhaps itself seeded by Russian intelligence! — and triggered the Russia probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The problem is that this assertion both ignores the known predicates for the Russia probe, and it doesn’t fit with the timeline of when the probe began. The FBI didn’t obtain the dossier until <a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'>mid-September 2016</a>, according to an internal inspector general report, after the Russia investigation was already underway.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In 2018, it was revealed that the dossier had been an important part of an application to obtain a warrant surveilling Carter Page. That warrant, obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), included allegations from the dossier as a reason to surveil him. (The application acknowledged that Steele was “was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit” Trump’s campaign.) The warrant was granted and later renewed several times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Only after Page left the campaign, however. When allegations from the Steele dossier were made public (apparently by Steele), Page resigned from the campaign. It was after that point that the surveillance warrant was granted. This problem with the timeline has been attributed to some multidimensional chess — that the warrant was a back door to investigate others close to Trump, for example — but that Page had previously been identified by a Russian intelligence agent as <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/15/politics/russia-spy-recruitment-tactics-fbi-carter-page/index.html' target='_blank'>a possible recruitment target</a> seems salient.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The dossier’s allegations have by now been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/23/steele-dossier-igor-danchenko-indictment-scrutiny/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>shown to not be credible</a>. There are valid questions about including its claims in the FISA warrant. But neither that warrant nor the dossier itself were predicates for the Russia investigation itself. For years, Trump and his allies have claimed that the Russia investigation stemmed from the dossier <i>because</i> it was sketchy and <i>because</i> it was paid for indirectly by lawyers working for Clinton. But that doesn’t make it true.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A few months after Mueller took over the Russia investigation, we learned that an FBI officials working on his team had been removed. That official, Peter Strzok, was a counterintelligence officer who had also been central to launching Crossfire Hurricane — the internal code name for the Russia investigation — in the first place. He was removed by Mueller after it was discovered that he had exchanged messages disparaging Trump and other elected officials with another FBI official, Lisa Page.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Those messages launched a slew of arguments aimed at undermining the Russia investigation broadly. Strzok was accused of ginning up the probe out of animus toward Trump, a belief that a later investigation by the Justice Department inspector general <a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'>found to be unwarranted</a>. His exchange with Page in which he referred to the need to probe possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia as being akin to a young person getting an “insurance policy” was repeatedly cited as evidence he wanted to blackmail Trump — although he <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/14/what-strzok-page-insurance-policy-text-was-actually-about/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40' target='_blank'>explained credibly under oath</a> that he was simply stating that they couldn’t allow the possibility of a connection to go unexamined in the event that Trump  won (which at the time seemed unlikely).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The huge trove of messages (which, despite a different set of rumors, were <a href='https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-8227360079' target='_blank'>not intentionally destroyed</a>) allowed for Trump supporters to pick out various phrases as sinister or significant even when they weren’t. There was a brief flurry of attention paid to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/24/russia-probe-theories-that-trump-has-empowered-barr-investigate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41' target='_blank'>a message about “OCONUS lures”</a> — an apparent reference to informants outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). But this was part of Strzok’s job and was not shown to be related to the Russia probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That particular idea gained some traction after it was revealed that the FBI had <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is-no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>employed a confidential informant</a> to probe members of Trump’s team. This was dubbed Spygate and became Trump’s new explanation for how he was right about having been under surveillance all along. (Trump <a href='https://apnews.com/23b9456c12484b6cb31c93da269a6159/Seething-over-Russia-probe,-Trump-tears-into-%27spygate' target='_blank'>told an ally</a> that he liked to call the informant a “spy” specifically for the pejorative connotations.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That informant, though, reached out to Carter Page and George Papadopoulos only after they were already on the FBI’s radar screen. That same inspector general report determined that there was “no evidence that the FBI used CHSs” — confidential human sources — “or UCEs” — undercover employees — “to interact with members of the Trump campaign prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“After the opening of the investigation,” it continues, “we found no evidence that the FBI placed any CHSs or UCEs within the Trump campaign or tasked any CHSs or UCEs to report on the Trump campaign.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As should be obvious, that inspector general report did a lot to undercut the narratives promoted by Trump and his allies. So, as soon as it came out, Attorney General William P. Barr released a statement in concert with U.S. Attorney John Durham <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/barr-durham-ig-report-russia-investigation.html' target='_blank'>undercutting its determinations</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>By then, Durham had already been tapped to conduct an investigation into the investigation: to figure out whether Trump’s efforts to cast himself as unfairly targeted held water. The inspector general report, by making an objective assessment that it didn’t, stepped on Durham’s (and therefore Barr’s and therefore Trump’s) toes, hence the statement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Durham and Barr began scouring the available evidence, going so far as to <a href='https://www.thedailybeast.com/barr-went-to-rome-to-hear-a-secret-tape-from-joseph-mifsud-the-professor-who-helped-ignite-the-russia-probe' target='_blank'>travel to Italy</a> to evaluate whether the understood predicate for the investigation — Papadopoulos being told that Russia had Clinton emails — was valid. But, for months, no alternate explanation emerged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Before Trump left office, Durham’s role was shifted to special counsel, giving him the same protection from President Biden that Mueller had from Trump. But Durham has not produced much. He obtained an <a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/russian-national-indicted-making-false-statements-fbi' target='_blank'>indictment</a> against Igor Danchenko, one of the sources for the Steele dossier and one <a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/grand-jury-indicts-dc-attorney-making-false-statements-fbi-2016-regarding-alleged' target='_blank'>against an attorney</a> who worked for the law firm employed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Which brings us to this week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In October 2020, the campaign looming, the political ally Trump put in charge of the national intelligence directorate <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'>released a lette</a><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'>r</a> pointedly suggesting that the Russia investigation was a function of Clinton’s campaign. The evidence? Apparently that the CIA had identified discussion among Russian sources alleging that Clinton had approved a campaign message trying to link Trump to Russia on July 26, 2016.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was, in fact, five days before Crossfire Hurricane was launched. But it was after there were already <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/the-trump-russia-money-question-in-24-steps/?itid=lk_inline_manual_58' target='_blank'>numerous public questions</a> about Trump’s connections to and sympathies toward Russia and Putin. That Russia got intelligence that Clinton had made linking Trump to Russia part of her campaign strategy in late July is both unremarkable (her campaign manager, Robby Mook, had already raised it in television interviews) and unrelated to the FBI probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The appeal here is obvious, though, as it was with the Steele dossier. Blaming Clinton for the Russia probe scratches two itches at once: casts Trump as innocent and Clinton as guilty.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Durham’s indictment of Michael Sussman, the attorney who worked for the firm hired by Clinton’s campaign, prompted a flurry of similar allegations. He had come to the FBI with <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?itid=lk_inline_manual_60' target='_blank'>a dubious claim</a> about a connection between Trump’s private company and a Russian bank — which to Trump supporters became proof that Clinton had tried to gin up this controversy and therefore the Russia probe. But that allegation was incidental to the Russia investigation (far more even than the Carter Page FISA warrant), coming months after the investigation began. During Sussman’s trial, Mook testified that Clinton had approved a messaging campaign elevating the dubious claim, an admission that titillated Fox News types. But it was completely irrelevant to the Russia investigation. Like the October 2020 story, it was about campaign messaging, not federal investigations.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Sussman prosecution included other efforts to elevate minor points as dispositive of Trump’s having been unfairly targeted. There was the flutter of excitement over the Trump White House having been surveilled by Sussman as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/18/john-durham-dumps-small-bucket-water-forest-fire-he-sparked/?itid=lk_inline_manual_61' target='_blank'>hinted at in a Durham court filing</a> — but that didn’t happen. Instead, researchers who were clients of Sussman’s had obtained data from the White House during the Obama administration that they had analyzed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One would think that, by that point, Trump’s allies would be skeptical of new assertions about how the Russia investigation began. After all, not only have there been repeated claims about what happened that have been shown to be baseless, but there also has been nothing that has undercut the official story about how the probe began (even after Barr and Durham went to Italy in the apparent hope of doing so).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But, again, the point isn’t the evidence. The point is the belief that Trump was unfairly accused. That belief is not driven by evidence, so it can’t be undercut by a lack of evidence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is still important to note that there is no evidence for it. And not for lack of trying to find some.</p>"

This fed into long-running allegations of the government “spying” on Trump, who chose Flynn as his national security adviser.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We knew before that this theory had fallen apart. We now know just how spectacularly.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>BuzzFeed News late Tuesday revealed <a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'>a previously top-secret Justice Department report</a> that details the findings of a review ordered by Trump’s attorney general, William P.

(Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI about these calls.) And there were valid questions early on about the Obama administration’s use of unmasking, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/04/susan-rice-isnt-a-smoking-gun-but-she-does-have-some-explaining-to-do/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9' target='_blank'>as we wrote in 2017</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the allegations almost always went beyond the known facts.

But speaking to the FBI later, Flynn denied having discussed sanctions. He pleaded guilty to that offense, but Barr’s Justice Department later made the extraordinary decision to try to have the case dismissed, and <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynn-trump-pardon/2020/11/25/3cd79198-2e65-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>a lame-duck President Trump pardoned Flynn</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Bash’s report becomes public after we already knew his review had resulted in no criminal charges.

Often, it wasn’t just “this seems fishy”; it was that “this is a proven scandal.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After Ignatius’s report, a Bloomberg News columnist reported in April 2017 that former Obama national security adviser <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-04-03/top-obama-adviser-sought-names-of-trump-associates-in-intel' target='_blank'>Susan Rice had requested unmaskings</a> in intelligence reports related to Trump’s campaign and transition period.

Robert Wallach, a California lawyer who came to Washington in the early 1980s as an adviser to presidential counselor Edwin Meese III, only to become a central figure in the Reagan-era Wedtech bribery scandal, in which he was first convicted and later freed after defending himself in court, died May 15 at his home in Alameda, Calif. He was 88.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The death was announced by the San Francisco law firm of Rains Lucia Stern, where Mr. Wallach worked in recent years. The cause was not disclosed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Early in his career, Mr. Wallach established a reputation as one of California’s top trial lawyers, winning the state’s first million-dollar settlement in a medical malpractice case, followed by a $3.6 million verdict in New Mexico, after a child suffered brain damage at birth.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In San Francisco, he was known as a liberal Democrat who briefly sought the U.S. Senate nomination in 1976 as a supporter of gay rights and legalized marijuana. By 1980, Mr. Wallach had become a supporter of the presidential campaign of Republican Ronald Reagan, largely because of his friendship with Meese, one of Reagan’s top advisers. Meese had been Mr. Wallach’s law school classmate and moot court partner at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After Reagan’s election, Mr. Wallach came to Washington as an informal adviser to Meese, who was counselor to the president before becoming attorney general in 1985.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was named a U.S. Representative for Human Rights and served on the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, but beyond sharing lunches and memos with Meese, he exercised little real authority.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Early in 1981, Mr. Wallach became the conduit to the Reagan administration for Wedtech, a small manufacturing firm in the Bronx seeking leverage on Pentagon projects. The company’s owners, unschooled in the ways of Washington, had hired a private detective to find out why they weren’t winning defense contracts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I didn’t think investigating the secretary of the Army and some procurement officers was going to help,” the detective, Harold Lipset, told The Washington Post in 1987. “I thought they needed a lobbyist in Washington and [Mr. Wallach] was the only one I knew who knew somebody in Washington.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach, who had spent his early years in New York City, saw the company’s blue-collar executives as the kind of scrappy underdogs he had been as a young man. He wrote memos to Meese touting Wedtech as an inspiring company on the rise, and Reagan praised it in speeches.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over the next few years, Wedtech landed Pentagon contracts worth an estimated $250 million, many of them awarded on a no-bid basis. Mr. Wallach admitted he had pocketed at least $1.3 million in stocks and fees as he helped the company gain a foothold in Washington.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Wedtech struggled to fulfill its contracts, federal prosecutors bought charges of bribery, racketeering and fraud against company officials, who had rewarded themselves with expensive cars and lavish meals. Several political figures were also swept up in the widening scandal, including Mr. Wallach, former White House communications director <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2006/03/28/strategist-reagan-adviser-lyn-nofziger/7b36b6f6-2b87-415a-b7a6-eabe5e94d392/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>Lyn Nofziger</a> and members of Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the end, more than 20 people were convicted in federal court. U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and former Bronx borough president Stanley Simon each spent more than two years in prison on corruption charges. Meese was not prosecuted, but in the midst of the scandal he resigned from his post as attorney general in 1988.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was convicted of racketeering in 1989 and sentenced to six years in prison, leading to the temporary suspension of his law practice in California while he appealed the decision. His conviction was overturned in 1991, after a key witness was found to have committed perjury. (Nofziger and others similarly had their convictions reversed.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Still, Mr. Wallach’s legal troubles were not over, and in 1993 he faced a new trial in New York on similar charges. He refused to make a plea deal, maintaining he had never committed a crime in promoting Wedtech to federal officials.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Having spent more than $1 million on his defense and still owing more than $700,000, Mr. Wallach was reduced to acting as his own attorney almost out of desperation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If I get convicted a second time, I have nothing left,” he said. “I will lose everything, including my livelihood.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When the arguments were finished, the deadlocked jury could not reach a decision. The judge dismissed all charges against Mr. Wallach, who went back to San Francisco to rebuild his career.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Eugene Robert Wallach was born on April 11, 1934, in New York City. His parents worked in a hat factory and divorced when their son was 7.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where she worked in an airplane assembly plant during World War II.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was a champion debater in high school and graduated in 1955 from the University of Southern California. As a law student at Berkeley, he became especially close to Meese, as they studied together in the Meese family basement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I used to love going to their home,” he told journalist James Traub for his 1990 book about the Wedtech scandal, “Too Good to Be True.” “Ed and I were writing briefs down in the basement, his mother would come down with the sandwiches. It was right out of ‘Andy Hardy.’ It was the kind of home I had never experienced.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After graduating in 1958, Mr. Wallach joined a San Francisco law firm, then called Walkup &amp; Downing, and soon became recognized as a top courtroom advocate. He established a solo practice in 1971 and was known for a string of victories, often in cases involving accidents or medical malpractice. One of his courtroom victories, involving Girl Scouts burned in a car crash, led to the adoption of median barriers on some California highways.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“He was known as being the best lawyer in the courtroom in front of a jury,” Eustace de St. Phalle, a partner at Rains Lucia Stern, said in an interview. “He was always listening and was a great strategist.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Mr. Wallach’s legal reputation grew, he cultivated an air of eccentricity: He became known as “e. bob” — spelling his name without capital letters — and often went out in public with an exotic Saluki dog. He wore a yellow rose in his lapel.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He was married two times, to Barbara Wallach and later to Glenda Jones. Survivors include three daughters from his first marriage and seven grandchildren.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After returning to San Francisco, Mr. Wallach represented the Fang family as it purchased the San Francisco Examiner newspaper in 2000 from the Hearst company. He was also the longtime corporate counsel of the Sharper Image retail firm.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach taught at several Bay Area law schools and was an informal mentor to countless lawyers. He joined Rains Lucia Stern in 2016 and continued to practice law through 2019. According to the firm, he tried 283 cases that reached a verdict — and lost only 14 times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The only thing I’m guilt-ridden about,” Mr. Wallach said in 1993, “is my stupidity and poor judgment in venturing off into the minefields of Washington.”</p>"

How close was the Justice Department — specifically a high-ranking Trump ally, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-justice-department-overturn-election/2021/01/22/b7f0b9fa-5d1c-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>Jeffrey Clark</a> — to publicly saying that it was concerned about election fraud claims in battleground states such as Georgia?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Such a statement would have lent weight to Trump and his allies’ baseless claims even though they been thrown out in courts across the country, including by Trump-appointed and other Republican judges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also seeks to shed light on the actions of officials such as then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who played a major role in putting people who had plans to overturn the election results in front of the president, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/09/inside-mark-meadowss-final-push-keep-trump-power/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31'>reports The Post’s Michael Kranish.</a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But in the government, there were also strong pockets of resistance to Trump and his allies. Justice Department officials <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/durbin-report-trump-pressure-justice/2021/10/07/b51712d4-2769-11ec-8d53-67cfb452aa60_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_32'>threatened mass resignations</a> if Trump put Clark in charge of the Justice Department. (Trump never did install Clark in the top job.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also will delve into efforts to put forward alternate slates of electors who would vote for Trump. Republican officials in at least five states falsely declared that Trump won and that  the alternates were the true electors for their states; the Justice Department is <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/politics/fake-trump-electoral-certificates-justice-department/index.html?utm_campaign=wp_the_5_minute_fix&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_fix' target='_blank'>reviewing what happened.</a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee is particularly interested in unraveling the origins of this mass radicalization, which manifested in the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812 — this time, led by ordinary Americans rather than foreign soldiers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Washington Post’s Jacqueline Alemany, Josh Dawsey and Amy Gardner <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/04/jan-6-committee-set-make-its-case-public-with-prime-time-hearing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39' target='_blank'>report </a>that the committee plans to spend a significant amount of time on this topic: The panel wants to flesh out for the public what extremists and extremist threats look like, and how <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/21/oversight-trump-disinformation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39' target='_blank'>disinformation </a>spreads. It’s<b> </b>also focused on how right-wing groups got involved in the attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The government  in January charged the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, and 10 others with seditious conspiracy, a rare charge alleging they conspired to overthrow the government. And this week, seditious conspiracy indictments were handed down against Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, the former longtime chairman of the Proud Boys, and four of his top lieutenants.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the committee is also up against a wider cultural tolerance, within the Republican Party, of what happened on Jan. 6 and of attempts to undermine the 2020 election. Top Republican lawmakers — even former vice president Mike Pence, whose life was threatened by the attackers — have downplayed what happened. It’s now <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/us/jan-6-attendees.html'>a badge of honor in some circles</a> to have been in D.C. protesting election results or to be labeled an insurrectionist, even as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/24/madison-cawthorn-insurrectionist-challenge/?itid=lk_inline_manual_42'>the courts debate</a> whether people who participated can run for office. Republicans in Pennsylvania just nominated<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/18/doug-mastriano-republican-pennsylvania/?itid=lk_inline_manual_42'> Doug Mastriano</a>, an election denier who passed through police barricades at the Capitol on Jan. 6, for governor. (He has said he did not enter the building and left when he realized the protest had turned violent.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Congress was convening that day to certify each state’s electoral votes, Trump took to a stage down the street from the Capitol and told his supporters: “I said something is wrong here, something is really wrong, can’t have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore,” <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/annotated-trump-speech-jan-6-capitol/?itid=lk_inline_manual_44' target='_blank'>he declared</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He had spent months before that falsely claiming in apocalyptic, sometimes violent language that the election was stolen from him. (“Be there, be wild,” he had tweeted, inviting his supporters to Washington for a “Stop the Steal” rally taking place just before<b> </b>the final step in the presidential certification process.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Much of the Republican Party apparatus geared up to support his election fraud claims. A majority of House Republicans signed onto a baseless, last-ditch lawsuit led by Republican state attorneys general asking the Supreme Court to step in and overturn the results in swing states Trump lost. Republican lawyers took election fraud claims to courts across the country — and often <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/23/why-trump-campaigns-big-legal-flameout-pennsylvania-seems-like-turning-point-even-republicans/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48' target='_blank'>got laughed out of court</a>. Conservative Republican senators announced they would reject certain states’ results on the 6th; one of them,  Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), was photographed giving Trump supporters a fist pump the day of the attack. Two local Republican election officials in Michigan originally voted to reject Detroit’s election results before changing their minds after an outcry from voters there. The Republican National Committee cheered on much of this.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The question the committee must answer is: How is all this connected to the attack? Was the insurrection a spontaneous outburst led by some bad actors in the crowd? Or is there evidence the violence was fed — or even coordinated — by government officials and the president himself, after months laying the groundwork for it?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Capitol is one of the most open complexes in Washington. But Capitol police had upped their security measures ahead of Jan. 6, aware that Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally down the street  near the White House could get out of hand. </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So how did those protesters march up to the Capitol, overwhelm police, knock down barricades, and take over the House and Senate floors for a time, as well as top lawmakers’ offices? Five people died in the Jan. 6 attack or in the immediate aftermath, and 140 police officers were assaulted. The Capitol Police chief resigned a day after the insurrection.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the committee has debated how much to delve into that question, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/inside-jan-6-committee-key-questions-remain-hearings-loom/?itid=lk_inline_manual_56'>report The Post’s Jacqueline Alemany and Josh Dawsey</a>. Should the focus be on the building or the people who invaded it? “The Capitol didn’t attack itself,” a spokesman for Cheney  told them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Another aspect of this question is how the military responded. It took about three hours for members of the National Guard to respond, despite the Capitol Police begging for backup.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Congressional investigators have interviewed top Defense Department officials to try to put together a timeline of how and when the military responded to the attack. They also want to know whether Trump loyalists in the  department worked to activate martial law during the attack, an idea that was brought to Trump’s attention before and after the attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/review-says-pentagon-reacted-appropriately-jan-6-riot-n1284074'>An independent review</a> within the Defense Department found that military leaders responded appropriately.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also wants to share policy prescriptions to keep this from ever happening again.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One idea members seem to be coalescing around is reforming the Electoral Count Act, a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/05/eca-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_62'>law</a> dating  to the 1880s that governs how Congress approves states’ electoral votes. Lawmakers want to make it much harder for members of Congress to challenge states’ results and make it crystal clear that the vice president, who presides over the process, can’t override the will of voters while counting the votes.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But states, not Congress, control elections. So Congress has limited power to prevent state lawmakers or secretaries of state from overriding the popular vote. Before Trump set his sights on stopping the certification of the vote in Congress, he was pressuring state officials to overturn results in <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/election-overturn-plans/?itid=lk_inline_manual_63' target='_blank'>Georgia and Michigan</a>, among others.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee has also been looking at how Trump may have abused or considered abusing emergency power laws. These laws could have allowed the military to seize voting machines and require a rerun of the election. Trump also could have declared martial law,  imposing curfews and essentially extending his leadership indefinitely.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There’s no proof Trump considered declaring martial law.

In the 2019 fiscal year, when Hunter Biden purchased his gun, federal prosecutors received 478 referrals for lying on Form 4473 — and filed just 298 cases, according to data extracted from the U.S. attorneys’ case management system. That’s out of approximately 27 million background checks undertaken <a href='https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view' target='_blank'>in a 12-month period</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The numbers were roughly similar for fiscal 2018 (444 referrals and 271 cases) and fiscal 2020 (433 referrals and 243 cases).

While everyone “thought I was safe and sound at the center, I sat in my room and smoked the crack I’d tucked away in my traveling bag,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>About two weeks after the purchase of the gun, Biden’s then-girlfriend, Hallie, his brother’s widow, threw the .38 revolver into a trash can behind a grocery store across the street from a high school. “I think she believes I was gonna kill myself,” Biden told police, <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/25/sources-secret-service-inserted-itself-into-case-of-hunter-bidens-gun-477879' target='_blank'>according to the police report obtained by Politico</a>. The gun went missing but was later recovered and no charges were filed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>An attorney for Hunter Biden did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The data released by the Justice Department does not show how many people might have been prosecuted for falsely answering the question about active drug use. But <a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22015887-glenn-kessler-1604-resp-docs' target='_blank'>a review of such cases in Delaware</a>, also provided to The Fact Checker, shows that in fiscal 2019, only three Form 4473 cases were referred for prosecution in the state — and the U.S. attorney opted not to bring them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Many of the prosecutions concerned obvious instances of “straw buyers,” such as a woman purchasing a gun while on the phone with a friend receiving instructions about what type of gun to buy. Straw buyers are often acting on behalf of people who would not pass a background check, such as a felon. Keeping guns out of the hands of people who already have committed heinous crimes is probably a higher priority than a drug abuser.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The names in the referrals were redacted for privacy reasons, but a Justice Department official said none of the referrals mentioned Hunter Biden.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A <a href='https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipotfipf-fs.pdf' target='_blank'>1990 Justice Department feasibility study</a> noted how difficult it was to bring cases against people who falsely answer questions on Form 4473. Unlike the rich paper trail that exists for felons, no such record exists for drug abusers, the study said, noting that it is against the law to disclose “the medical records of persons who have been engaged in a drug rehabilitation program funded by the federal government.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Erik Longnecker, an ATF spokesman, said only that “the tweet is accurate.” He referred questions about the pace of prosecutions to the Justice Department.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a statement to The Fact Checker, another Justice Department official indicated that the Form 4473 cases were determined not to have enough evidence for a successful prosecution.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Declinations of matters referred to a U.S. attorney’s office can occur for a variety of reasons,” the statement said. “Initial declinations typically occur when the prosecutor makes an immediate determination that a matter is not sufficient or suitable for prosecution. The large majority of ‘later declinations’ — declinations where a USAO has delved into the facts and circumstances of the matter — show that suspects investigated [under false-statement statues] were declined for federal prosecution due to a lack of sufficient evidence in the matter referred.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>(<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48'>About our rating scale</a>)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Send us facts to check by filling out </b><a href='https://hosted-washpost.submissionplatform.com/sub/hosted/5c911f64439aa20034c4f0b7'><b>this form</b></a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Sign up for The Fact Checker </b><a href='http://wapo.st/1OGIZWF'><b>weekly newsletter</b></a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>The Fact Checker is a verified </b><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/#code?itid=lk_inline_manual_51'><b>signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles</b></a></p>"

Michael Guest is fighting to keep his seat partly because he voted to establish a congressional committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, another sign that incumbents who don’t take the hard line position that the 2020 election was invalid could find themselves struggling to survive primary elections.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Guest, who is running for his third term, faced a primary challenge from Michael Cassidy, a former Navy pilot, who centered his campaign around the notion that Guest was not conservative enough for deep-red Mississippi. Cassidy narrowly beat Guest in Tuesday’s primary, but neither received more than 50 percent of the vote, forcing them into a head-to-head runoff on June 28.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cassidy is among several Republicans prevailing in primary elections this year who have continued to spread false claims that the 2020 election results were stolen from former president Donald Trump. In Ohio, J.R. Majewski, who attended the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally and who has ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory, beat out three Republicans in a congressional primary. In Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano, who also attended the rally of election deniers on the National Mall, won the state’s gubernatorial primary.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Guest was among the 147 Republicans who, after the Jan. 6 attack, voted against certifying President Biden’s victory. A month later he signed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit challenging the 2020 results. Most recently, he co-sponsored the “Women’s Bill of Rights” resolution to define “sex” as a person’s biological sex — an attempt to weaken rights for transgender women — which he said is needed as “the radical left continues to push a woke ideology on women.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But to Cassidy, Guest’s decision to join 34 other House Republicans to set up a special commission to review the activities surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol attack was an unforgivable act of disloyalty.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Neither Cassidy nor Guest immediately responded to requests for comment on their race.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a local news interview a week ago, Cassidy attacked Guest over his support for the Jan. 6 committee, which begins its public hearings on Thursday. “It is the capstone of the democratic witch hunt of Trump and the republican party. The media and the democrats worked in cahoots with each other, so blinded by hatred of Trump,” he told <a href='https://www.columbianprogress.com/local-content-politics-state/getting-know-3-republican-primary-candidates-michael-cassidy#sthash.uqq5BWZO.dpbs' target='_blank'>the Columbian-Progress</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon interviewed Cassidy on Wednesday for his War Room show, a popular platform for the Make America Great Again movement. Candidates who appear on Bannon’s show are Trump devotees and believe the 2020 election was stolen from him. In exchange for that fealty, Bannon introduces them to his millions of radio listeners, which also can translate to new donors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“That Mr. Guest voted for the Jan. 6 commission, when people found out about that, they were furious if they didn’t know about it already. And so it was actually somewhat easy pickings once you tell people about your congressman,” Cassidy told Bannon. “He continues to defend that vote to this day … he hasn’t said anything about the political prisoners being held for being up on the Capitol that day.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump has endorsed dozens of candidates at every level of government this year, but Cassidy did not receive the former president’s coveted support ahead of the primary.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Congressional hopefuls aren’t the only candidates who are winning Republican primaries around the country. Republican voters in two states so far have chosen secretary of state candidates who embrace the lies about the election being stolen.

Then on June 3 the word was mentioned once, with reporter Griff Jenkins telling anchor Bret Baier that “the largest caravan ever to depart Tapachula” was expected to leave that Mexican city Monday — that is, June 6 — headed for the United States.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The network was <a href='https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=caravan&amp;ts=1w&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1' target='_blank'>off to the races</a>. “Caravan” came up seven times Saturday, 26 times Sunday and 58 times Monday. Another wave of Fox News migrant-caravan coverage had begun.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We’ve been through this before. On at least four previous occasions, Fox News has amped up coverage of groups of migrants gathering in Mexico or Central America to travel to the United States. And on at least three of those four prior occasions, the trigger was more obviously politics than policy.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is the case that in recent years groups of migrants have gathered to make the trip to the U.S. border as a group. In part, that’s <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/24/migrant-caravan-updates/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7' target='_blank'>a function of safety</a>; it’s harder for drug cartels and other criminals to prey on migrants traveling in a large group than it is to pick off isolated travelers. But that grouping also offers Fox News a visual image it finds hard to resist: large numbers of migrants headed to the United States. Marching along like an invading force. Never mind that the caravan identified by Jenkins — the largest ever, he said — is made up of 11,000 people. That’s less than 5 percent of the number of people stopped at the border in April.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So have Fox News’s past amplification of migrant caravans actually correlated to surges in migration? Well, considering the number of people of stopped at the border: no. They have, however often correlated to elections and policy proposals.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Let’s consider five such spikes, including the most recent. They’re labeled below.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 1. </b>The first spike in Fox News’s mentions of migrant caravans in the past five years came in April 2018. That was the same month that Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href='https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-announces-zero-tolerance-policy-criminal-illegal-entry' target='_blank'>announced</a> a “zero tolerance” policy for migration, a policy that led to President Donald Trump’s infamous <a href='https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-discussing-immigration-enforcement-actions' target='_blank'>family separation policy</a> that May.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In March 2018, 50,347 migrants were apprehended at the border. In April, 51,168 were. In May, the number increased only slightly to 51,862. The caravan had no discernible effect on migration, though coverage of it would certainly help Sessions’s assertion that the “situation at our Southwest Border is unacceptable.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 2. </b>The next spike came a few months later, peaking in October 2018. This was the first Fox News-led caravan coverage that spurred broader national interest, in part thanks to the proximity of the 2018 midterm elections. (You can see that measured in Google searches for the term.) Two percent of Fox News’s 15-second segments that month mentioned the word “caravan.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This coverage was slow to fade out, only really ending by March 2019. Why? Perhaps in part because Trump had decided to fight Congress over funding for a wall on the border, eventually spurring the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. In February 2019, Trump announced a national emergency at the border that allowed him to divert funds from the Defense Department to build that wall (and thereby to fulfill a long-standing campaign pledge).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>From October 2018 to January 2019, an average of 60,590 migrants were apprehended at the border each month, ranging from 58,000 to 62,000. Only after the coverage of the caravan faded that spring (and after Trump announced the emergency) did apprehensions begin to climb.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 3.</b> Shortly after President Biden took office, Fox News again turned to coverage of migrant caravans. In January 2021, the network saw an increase in discussion of caravans. There was an increase in apprehensions both that month and in February 2021, though they began to surge significantly only in March.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 4.</b> The next spike came in October 2021, as Fox News was spending a great deal of time covering gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. You’ll notice that in the months leading up to last October, the number of apprehensions actually declined substantially, from 210,000 in August to 165,000 that month. There was an increase in November, of about 10,000 more apprehensions.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 5. </b>That brings us to the current surge. It makes up a larger percentage of Fox News’s coverage in part because the month is young. By the end of the month, the percentage will probably have declined. It is still noticeable.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What’s the possible political trigger? Well, Jenkins’s report last week was centered on Biden’s effort to end a policy called Title 42 that allowed for quick deportation of apprehended migrants because due to the pandemic. Republicans have warned that ending Title 42 would increase the number of migrants coming to this country, something that the administration has been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/29/border-pandemic-title-42-immigration/?itid=lk_inline_manual_27' target='_blank'>working to prepare for</a>. Jenkins’s report centered on the large number of migrants waiting for that policy to be lifted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So, once again, caravans are asked by Fox News to do the legwork of representing a perceived invasion of foreigners at the border — despite years of not significantly affecting migration data at all.</p>"

Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote separately agreeing with the judgment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In dissent, the court’s three liberal justices said they would have allowed the Washington state man’s lawsuit to proceed against the federal agent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the court had “absolutely immunized from liability” thousands of Border Patrol agents “no matter how egregious the misconduct or resultant injury.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Such cases “play a critical role in deterring unconstitutional conduct by federal law enforcement officers,” wrote Sotomayor, who was joined by Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The case was brought in 2017 by Robert Boule, who owned the Smuggler’s Inn, a <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/smuggler-s-inn-the-border-town-bed-and-breakfast-whose-visitors-don-t-always-stay-the-night-1.4082384' target='_blank'>bed-and-breakfast</a> located in Washington state along the Canadian border. Boule had a complicated relationship with federal agents, according to the court’s opinion. He sometimes served as a paid, confidential informant, helping agents identify people crossing the border illegally near his property. He also provided lodging and shuttle service to those crossing illegally, driving a black SUV with the license plate “SMUGLER.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Agents had seized from the inn shipments of illegal drugs, the opinion states, and Boule was recently convicted in Canadian court on human trafficking charges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Boule sued a Border Patrol agent whom he accused of unlawfully entering his property, and shoving and pushing him to the ground during a 2014 encounter involving a guest of Boule’s from Turkey. The agent, Erik Egbert, checked the guest’s immigration papers, which were up-to-date, and the guest unlawfully crossed the border into Canada that evening, the court’s opinion states. Boule alleged that the agent violated his constitutional rights by using excessive force and retaliating against Boule for complaining to the agent’s superiors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Central to the case is a 1971 ruling in <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics </i>in which the Supreme Court recognized that federal officers can be sued in some instances, even if such lawsuits had not been explicitly authorized by Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But since then, the court has moved to restrict when individuals can bring such federal lawsuits. Two years ago, a divided court ruled that the family of a Mexican teenager killed by a Border Patrol agent in a cross-border shooting could not sue in U.S. courts. Before that, the court said in 2017 that senior U.S. government officials cannot be held liable for the alleged unconstitutional treatment of noncitizens detained after 9/11.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the majority on Wednesday had rewritten and stretched its own legal standard “beyond recognition” to “close the door to Boule’s claim.” The conduct at issue, she noted, took place on U.S. soil and the injury was to a U.S. citizen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This case does not remotely implicate national security,” she wrote, adding that “Congress has not provided that federal law enforcement officers may enter private property near a border at any time or for any purpose.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Thomas said the reasoning in earlier decisions involving national security applies to Boule’s case because the Border Patrol agent was carrying out his duty to stop people from illegally entering or leaving the United States. Boule, he said, had other ways to address his concerns about the agent’s conduct and noted that he had filed a complaint that led to a year-long internal investigation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The majority stopped short of overruling <i>Bivens</i>, but Gorsuch wrote separately to emphasize that the court should not leave the false impression that future claims will be viable.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Weighing the costs and benefits of new laws is the bread and butter of legislative committees. It has no place in federal courts charged with deciding cases and controversies under existing law,” he wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The court’s decision reverses a unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Egbert’s lawyer argued that allowing Boule’s claims would undermine the ability of Border Patrol agents to engage in searches as part of their immigration-enforcement responsibilities. The Biden administration backed the agent’s position.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Steven A. Engel, an attorney who filed a brief in support of Egbert on behalf of former U.S. attorneys general from Republican administrations, said the court got it right.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The plaintiff here could not point to any federal statute authorizing his suit, and the Court thus properly reaffirmed the constitutional principle that the power to create such legal remedies rests with Congress,” Engel said in an email Wednesday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Boule’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Does he actually believe any of the myriad other claims that had been fact-checked within weeks of that announcement? The <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3' target='_blank'>tens of thousands of things</a> that would be fact-checked by the time he left office? Or did he simply pretend to believe them? Was the truth in the middle, that he sort of believed them or convinced himself of them because it was useful to do so?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This has usually been an academic exercise, an exploration of Trump’s psychology. But in the wake of the attack at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the exercise became more concrete.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House select committee investigating that attack <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/understanding-criminal-allegation-jan-6-committee-is-constructing-against-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7'>believes</a> Trump committed crimes in the wake of his 2020 election loss. One is obstruction of an official proceeding, working to block the counting of electoral votes that day. Another is conspiracy to defraud the United States, centered on his having tried to obstruct “lawful governmental functions.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In each case, though, there’s a legal box to check. Trump must be shown to have tried to disrupt the transition of power to Joe Biden <i>corruptly</i>; that is, that he did so knowing he had no right to do so. There’s a difference between breaking the window of a jewelry store to steal diamonds and breaking the window to help put out a fire.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump says there was a fire. Those who had been closest to him for the past seven years, we are increasingly learning, assured him there wasn’t. So instead of declining to break the window, Trump replaced his most loyal people with others who insisted that the jewelry store was at immediate risk of burning down.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The most recently emergent example is Jared Kushner. In <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-jan-6.html' target='_blank'>a new report</a> for the New York Times, Peter Baker describes how Trump’s son-in-law decided against standing by the former president as he amplified false claims about the election being stolen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“No matter how vociferously Mr. Trump claimed otherwise, neither Mr. Kushner nor Ivanka Trump believed then or later that the election had been stolen, according to people close to them,” Baker writes. “While the president spent the hours and days after the polls closed complaining about imagined fraud in battleground states and plotting a strategy to hold on to power, his daughter and son-in-law were already washing their hands of the Trump presidency.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is by now a well-established feature of the Kushner-Ivanka public-relations system that people close to them will offer reporters a flawlessly complimentary portrait of the couple. But it is true that Kushner was not a common presence in the administration in the wake of the 2020 election loss. In fact, Baker reports, Kushner explicitly told Trump that he would not aid Trump’s effort to contest the election if former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was involved. Giuliani, not Kushner, then became the central face of the fight.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What Baker doesn’t establish is that either Kushner or Ivanka Trump told the president that the election hadn’t been stolen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“One of the most striking realizations that emerged … was how many people around Mr. Trump did not believe the election had been stolen but kept quiet or checked out,” Baker writes, pointing to longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks as one of those who challenged Trump’s claims. But there’s a difference between not helping Trump break the window and actively telling him he’s wrong about the fire. Kushner, it seems, only did the former.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In her new memoir, former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/kellyanne-conway-admits-trump-lost-quite-usefully-her/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>claims</a> that she told Trump he’d lost, a claim Trump denied.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I may have been the first person Donald Trump trusted in his inner circle who told him that he had come up short this time,” she wrote — though by that point she was already outside the actual inner circle, having left the administration before the election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At another point in her book, Conway implicitly agrees with Baker’s framing of the post-election White House.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“For a president who many thought surrounded himself with yes-men, that was never the case until 2020,” she wrote. “And it proved costly from November to January.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This is somewhat self-serving for Conway as she seeks to distance herself from what happened after Trump lost. But it’s also clearly true. People like Sidney Powell and John Eastman didn’t have roles in the administration before the election. After the election, though, they had Trump’s ear because he liked what they had to say.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Eastman offers a specific example of why this question of what Trump believed is important. He was the attorney who <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/01/what-did-john-eastman-really-want-have-happen/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>argued in favor</a> of having Mike Pence simply reject submitted electoral votes on Jan. 6 itself. His communications with Trump have become a subject of legal jousting, as he tries to keep them private under the aegis of attorney-client privilege and as the Jan. 6 committee argues that attorney-client privilege doesn’t exist when the discussions center on the commission of a crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In March, Eastman’s attorney <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/us/politics/jan-6-panel-trump-fraud.html' target='_blank'>told the Times</a> that there was no corrupt intent in his arguments about the election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Dr. Eastman and others absolutely believed that what they were doing was well-grounded in law and fact,” he said, “and was necessary for what they believed was the best interest of the country.” In <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/trump-lawyer-eastman-fraud-evidence/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32' target='_blank'>a court filing</a>, the same argument is made in slightly different language: “Countless examples of election illegality and fraud, and expert opinion indicating a high likelihood of fraud, were available to President Trump and Dr. Eastman at the time.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>See, they thought there was a fire!</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This argument, though, is hard to defend. Yes, there were people around Trump telling him that there were “countless examples” of fraud, but those examples were all quickly dispatched as unimportant or incorrect. There were other people telling him something else, of course, including his loyal-until-almost-the-end attorney general William P. Barr and (according to a committee filing) <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/understanding-criminal-allegation-jan-6-committee-is-constructing-against-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_34' target='_blank'>staff from Trump’s campaign</a>. Had Trump listened to the people he’d been listening to up until Nov. 3, 2020, he’d have heard something very different from what Eastman and Giuliani and Powell were saying in the weeks after. Which, of course, is why he didn’t listen to them or why (as with Kushner) they didn’t speak up.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There’s also reason to be skeptical that Trump and Eastman were sincere in their consideration of alleged fraud. In an email with a Pennsylvania legislator, Eastman recommended <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/11/john-eastmans-pennsylvania-gambit-was-even-weaker-than-it-might-seem/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'>inventing numbers</a> that would rationalize the legislature’s submitting an alternate slate of electors. This is not an example of something “well-grounded in law and fact.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump himself famously <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_38' target='_blank'>told</a> Georgia’s secretary of state that he “just want[ed] to find 11,780 votes” in the state, one more than needed to declare victory. Didn’t matter how, didn’t matter why, didn’t matter what the facts said. He simply wanted the votes — just enough votes — to be found.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Jared Kushner came to the White House as one of Trump’s most trusted allies. Literal family. He worked to keep Trump within the desired bounds. But at the end, Trump was apparently asked to choose between listening to his adviser-slash-son-in-law or to Giuliani, who was telling him the things he wanted to hear.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump decided to ally himself with those who were willing to indulge his fantasy. That will make it much harder for him to argue that he was simply acting in good faith.</p>"

So keep checking back for updates. But here are some early takeaways from the races we know about so far.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s become apparent that voters even in blue cities are willing to punish Democrats who are perceived as too soft on crime. Tuesday resulted in some particularly pronounced examples of that trend.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In San Francisco, voters made the historic decision to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/primaries-june-7-california-new-jersey/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8'>recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin</a>, who won office in 2019 while running on the idea of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/06/cehsa-boudin-recall/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8'>a less punitive criminal justice system</a>, including ending cash bail and sending fewer people to prison. The latest results show voters recalling him by a strong margin, 60 percent to 40 percent, with an estimated 61 percent of votes counted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Los Angeles, Rick Caruso and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who was once considered a contender to be President Biden’s vice president, look to be headed for a runoff in the mayor’s race. But Caruso, a former longtime Republican who made fighting crime the centerpiece of his campaign, led Bass by 42 to 37 percent early on.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The results come after voters <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/05/electoral-demise-defund-police/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11'>delivered similar verdicts in the 2021 elections</a>. In Minneapolis, Buffalo, Seattle and on Long Island in New York, they voted against candidates and measures related to the “defund the police” movement and ending cash bail. But Boudin might now be the chief example, given his policies and San Francisco’s reputation as one of the most liberal cities in the country.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>President Biden and other top Democrats have tried to steer their party away from “defund the police” and other related efforts, clearly worrying about the potential cost at the ballot box. And few in Congress have actually embraced that movement. But the local level has often been another matter, and Tuesday provided the latest warning sign about the potency of this issue.</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Later this week, the House Jan. 6 committee will begin <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/06/january-6-committee-hearing-schedule-how-to-watch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>holding public hearings on the Capitol insurrection</a>. And on Tuesday, lawmakers’ previous votes on a 9/11-style bipartisan Jan. 6 commission suddenly became a flash point.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), who was one of <a href='https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021154' target='_blank'>35 House Republicans to vote for the commission</a>, found himself unexpectedly fighting for his political life, in a result few saw coming. Guest and Michael Cassidy are now headed for a runoff, with neither getting a majority of the vote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Another House Republican who voted for the commission was Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.). He wound up surviving his primary against state Rep. Taffy Howard but was taking only about 59 percent of the vote — less than other statewide South Dakota GOP officials facing primaries. Howard has attacked Johnson for being too bipartisan, including by declining to sign on to then-President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As the Johnson example shows, it’s difficult to say how much of these dynamics stemmed from that particular vote. Unlike votes to impeach Trump, votes for the Jan. 6 commission (which failed in the Senate before the House launched a less bipartisan select committee) have yet to register as a major issue. But that’s in part because there is overlap between that issue and others in which members crossed partisan lines (such as the impeachment votes).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Another of the commission’s supporters in the House GOP, Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.), lost his primary last month. But that was against a fellow incumbent, Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) who also targeted McKinley for the latter’s vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So we’ll have to keep an eye on that.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Guest wasn’t the only Mississippi Republican struggling.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rep. Steven M. Palazzo is also headed for a runoff after trying to fend off a challenge stemming from his <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-ethics-office-says-theres-substantial-reason-to-believe-rep-steven-palazzo-misused-campaign-congressional-funds/2021/03/01/1227840c-7b00-11eb-85cd-9b7fa90c8873_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_30' target='_blank'>alleged misuse of funds</a>. He was at 32 percent, well shy of the majority needed to avoid a runoff, with 97 percent of the votes counted. That’s also a number that suggests an incumbent is likely to lose their runoff. (It appears his runoff opponent will be Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And in California, Reps. David G. Valadao (R) and Young Kim (R) were trying to finish first or second in their respective districts in the state’s top-two primary system.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Valadao was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment, but he escaped having to face a high-profile Trump-backed challenger. (His opponent, Chris Mathys, <a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Chris_Mathys' target='_blank'>lost GOP primaries in New Mexico in 2018 and 2020.</a>) Despite that, though, Valadao was taking 26 percent to Mathys’s 19 percent, with about one-third of the vote in. Whoever emerges will face Democrat Rudy Salas in a blue-leaning district.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kim was running in a substantially unfamiliar district after redistricting. So far, it looks like she’ll make the general election, taking 34 percent to Republican Greg Raths’s 24.5 percent, with more than half of the vote in.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Were more incumbents to fall, they would join four predecessors. McKinley and Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.) lost incumbent-vs.-incumbent matchups, while moderate Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) fell to a more liberal challenger in a substantially redrawn district, and Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) lost after a string of personal problems.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Virtually every primary night has allowed us to glean some clues about Trump’s hold over the GOP and status as a kingmaker — with <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/trump-endorse-thirty-percent/?itid=lk_inline_manual_38' target='_blank'>a decidedly mixed verdict</a> thus far.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tuesday’s primaries, by contrast, included few big tests. But there still were some notable results.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In New Jersey, Trump-aligned Republican Frank Pallotta pulled an upset against Nick De Gregorio. Democrats had attacked Pallotta for being too Trumpy, in a clear effort to elevate him. Though Trump had backed Pallotta in his failed 2020 bid for the same seat, he didn’t endorse him this time. But De Gregorio had the backing of the Bergen County GOP, a status which gives a candidate prominent ballot placement in New Jersey and almost always means they’ll win. (The winner faces Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer in a blue-leaning seat.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And in Montana, former Trump interior secretary Ryan Zinke was in a very tight race in his bid to return to Congress, leading former state senator Al Olszewski 41-40 with about 92 percent of expected votes in. Trump backed Zinke despite his resigning from the administration in 2018 <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/interior-secretary-zinke-resigns-amid-investigations/2018/12/15/481f9104-0077-11e9-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>amid ethics investigations</a>. Zinke was attacked from the right as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-ally-zinke-fights-claim-hes-too-liberal-for-montana/2022/05/26/2814d970-dcae-11ec-bc35-a91d0a94923b_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>supposedly being too liberal</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It looks like he’ll emerge, but it was another nail-biter for a Trump candidate.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In South Dakota, an <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/today-south-dakota-voters-decide-whether-make-medicaid-expansion-harder/?itid=lk_inline_manual_47' target='_blank'>attempted workaround</a> to thwart Medicaid expansion failed badly. Opponents of the expansion, which will be on the ballot in November, tried to get the state to adjust the threshold for it and similar ballot measures to 60 percent, rather than a simple majority. The practical impact of this proposed rule, which was on the primary ballot Tuesday, would’ve been a majority of voters deciding to prevent another majority from expanding Medicaid later this year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the end, it came nowhere close to a majority: constitutional Amendment C was defeated 67-33 early Wednesday. The thrust of the effort was clear: Proponents of Medicaid expansion have succeeded in the face of GOP opposition even in red states by using ballot measures, but the measures only once exceeded 60 percent approval — in Idaho, in 2018.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If a majority votes in favor of expanding Medicaid in November, South Dakota will the 39th state to do so.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Come January, it appears New Jersey will be sending two Robert Menendezes (Bobs Menendez?) to Congress. That’s after the senator’s son, Robert Menendez Jr., easily won a primary in the 8th Congressional District.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s very common for family members to win the House seats previously held by their relatives. Far less common is two generations of one family serving in Congress simultaneously; the New York Times <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/robert-menendez-jr-congress-albio-sires.html' target='_blank'>reported</a> this has happened only a handful of times. The last time appears to be when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) overlapped for two years with his father, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), a decade ago.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The younger Menendez, a lawyer and first-time candidate, will be a heavy favorite come November to take the House seat his father vacated to join the Senate in 2006.</p>"

Susie Lee (D-Nev.) wanted to make clear that she will defend law enforcement in Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I always open these up and say I do not want to defund the police, and in fact have voted multiple times to increase funding to police departments,” Lee, who is on a list of House Democrats seen as vulnerable in November, told a group that included representatives from the two local law enforcement associations, which recently endorsed her reelection campaign.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Lee’s pledge of support for law enforcement is being replicated across the country as Democratic lawmakers up and down the ballot scramble to assure voters that they’re not soft on crime. It’s a sea change from two years ago when, amid the height of racial justice protests, some leaders on the left began to rethink their approach to criminal justice.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Fears that Democrats are losing ground on crime were compounded by <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/primaries-june-7-california-new-jersey/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8' target='_blank'>Tuesday primary results</a>, which included the recall of San Francisco district attorney<b> </b>Chesa Boudin, whom voters saw as overly lenient toward criminals. In the Los Angeles mayor’s race, billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, a former Republican who ran as a Democrat and campaigned on a message of improving quality of life, was projected to go to a runoff with onetime favorite Rep. Karen Bass (D).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>President Biden echoed the concern Wednesday. “The voters sent a clear message last night: Both parties ought to step up and do something about crime, as well as gun violence,” Biden said ahead of his trip to Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He noted that the American Rescue Plan, the first major bill he signed into law, included billions of dollars for policing but complained that some places haven’t used the money. “It’s time the states and the localities spend the money they have to deal with crime, as well as retrain police officers, as well as provide for more community policing,” Biden said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Homicide rates in cities across the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/21/homicide-rates-have-soared-nationwide-mayors-see-chance-turnaround-2022/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13' target='_blank'>country have soared over the past two years</a>, with officials blaming a combination of pandemic-related changes to the criminal justice system and in some places new, more lenient policing policies.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In response, Democratic candidates across the country are showcasing a tougher approach on crime. In D.C., a liberal haven with primaries later this month, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser is running on her record of bolstering police in schools. “You have to have a mayor who’s willing to make tough calls and not just go along with trendy words of the day,” Bowser <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/16/dc-mayor-debate-crime-education-housing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14' target='_blank'>said in a recent debate where another Democratic candidate also sought a tough-on-crime mantle</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans are poised to capitalize on concerns about rising violence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Crime is the sleeper issue of this cycle,” said Chris Hartline, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the main group backing Senate Republicans.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He said fear about rising crime dovetails with inflation, still the top issue for voters, because quality of life contributes to a general sense of unease about the direction of the country. “It stretches beyond city politics to an issue that could move voters statewide,” Hartline said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced Wednesday morning that it will put $52.3 million behind political ads to back GOP House candidates in key races. The ads will use messaging that blames Democrats for spikes in violent crime in addition to inflation and poor management of the southern border.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We’re going to relentlessly remind Americans they are worse off than a year and a half ago,” NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer said in a statement issued Wednesday announcing that “soaring violent crime” will be among the attacks against Democrats this fall.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In states where the field is settled, the issue is already seeping into general-election campaigns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In an attempt to gin up online donations for author J.D. Vance, the Republican running for an open Senate seat in Ohio, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) praised Vance as “tough on crime.” In <a href='https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1528755947400740864?s=20&amp;t=WMN9aLI9E-la5gIHhbOKiA' target='_blank'>a posting on social media</a> that links to a fundraising page, Cotton attacked Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee in the Ohio race, for supporting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/23/biden-george-floyd-police-reform/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25' target='_blank'>passed the House but has stalled in the Senate</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tom Persico, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he’s encouraging House Democrats to confront head-on concerns that Democrats want to defund the police. “Attack the charge, say what you’re for, and then you can move on,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Nationally, Americans give Republicans an advantage of 12 percentage points on handling crime, according to a <a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21842070-2022-04-28-trend-for-release' target='_blank'>Washington Post-ABC News poll from April</a>. That’s a marked shift from last summer, when Americans were about evenly divided on which party is better positioned to contend with crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In recent weeks, Lee and other Democrats have co-sponsored bipartisan legislation with Republicans that would <a href='https://susielee.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-lee-announces-introduction-bipartisan-invest-protect-act-make-investments'>invest</a> in police departments to help recruit more officers and provide adequate resources to effectively train officers on safety, de-escalation and more. Other bills have also been proposed to incentivize national recruitment campaigns and reauthorize community policing grants to boost wages and increase police presence in rural towns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Front-line Democrats, those representing swing districts and most at risk of losing their seats, have spent the past month pushing leadership to hold votes on these bipartisan bills. Even if the effort faces little to no chance in the Senate, members and aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss negotiations, said the votes are worth taking so they can return to their districts and have evidence that proves a majority of Democrats support funding the police.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans are particularly hopeful that the heightened concerns about crime can help them with suburban voters, where they’ve lost ground in recent elections.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tuesday offered some evidence that they might be right. In New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, a suburban swath near New York City that the GOP views as a top target in November, law and order was top of mind.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Crime is the number one issue,” said Gerhard Otto, who is originally from South Africa and voted for the first time in a U.S. election Tuesday in Scotch Plains, N.J. “Things have gone backwards since I first visited in 2012,” Otto said after casting a ballot for Tom Kean Jr., who prevailed in the Republican primary.

Chesa Boudin (D) came into office in 2020 promising a different approach to fighting crime and, in a lopsided vote, San Franciscans rejected that approach. Even in liberal San Francisco, some leftist policies go too far.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But then there was the larger city to the south. In Los Angeles — even Democrat-heavy Los Angeles! — a former Republican was one of the top two finalists for mayor. In journalism they say that three makes a trend. When pressed, though, two will do, so: Democrats stumbling in their strongest state <a href='https://www.axios.com/2022/06/08/san-francisco-district-attorney-loses-recall' target='_blank'>portends horrors</a> for the party!</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Look, there’s certainly no sense in which these results are good news for the party.

It is true that both San Francisco and Los Angeles vote more heavily Democratic than the rest of the country. But the two are not equivalently blue. San Francisco has consistently voted much more heavily Democratic than has Los Angeles.

Cities overall have done so, as measured at the county level.

This question is largely distinct from the results on Tuesday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There’s another way in which San Francisco and Los Angeles diverge. The emergence of the information economy has caused incomes in San Francisco (and elsewhere in the Bay Area) to spike. The city is no longer the hippie, drifter wonderland it became famous for being.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This has an immediate practical effect: increased housing costs in particular have <a href='https://homelessness.ucsf.edu/blog/san-fransicko-incorrect-about-housing-affordability-and-homelessness' target='_blank'>contributed to homelessness</a>, a central part of discussions about how Boudin and the city’s leadership are failing. It’s not a stretch to assume that wealthier residents who have made substantial investments in property in the city are more wary about threats to property values. When Donald Trump announced he planned to focus on blue-state homelessness during his presidency, he <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/17/trump-reveals-motivation-his-anti-homelessness-push-foreign-real-estate-tenants/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>cited complaints</a> from real estate investors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So that’s the context, particularly important for considering Boudin. As district attorney, he was understandably accountable for the immediately tangible quality of life issues in the city like crime and homelessness. And crime did rise in the city in 2021 relative to 2020, though not exceptionally relative to other big cities. The number of crimes recorded in 2021 was also <a href='https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/San-Francisco-crime-Chesa-Boudin-London-Breed-16751930.php' target='_blank'>still lower</a> than in 2019.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In February, a member of the board of supervisors <a href='https://sfgov.org/policecommission/sites/default/files/Documents/PoliceCommission/PoliceCommission042022-SupervisorRonenletter%26Deptresponse.pdf' target='_blank'>noted</a> that the police department’s clearance rates had dropped — that is, the number of crimes solved — and linked that to the “political rift between the Police Department and District Attorney’s Office” which she worried was “causing a deliberate work stoppage by your Department.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Boudin’s was not the only successful recall in San Francisco in recent months. Earlier this year, a number of members of the school board were also recalled. As with the district attorney’s race, the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/11/trailer-san-franciscos-school-board-recalls-are-tearing-democrats-apart/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>situation was complicated</a>, a mix of frustration at leadership, pandemic-era changes and political opportunism. But there was one similarity between the two: recall supporters <a href='https://sfstandard.com/education/money-and-motives-school-board-recall/' target='_blank'>spent</a> far more money than opponents. In the Boudin recall, <a href='https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Groups-wanting-Chesa-Boudin-recalled-raise-more-17221264.php' target='_blank'>the gap</a> was more than 2 to 1 in support of recalling Boudin.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That was part of the story in Los Angeles, too. The former Republican who made the mayoral runoff, developer Rick Caruso, who switched his registration from “no party preference” to Democratic ahead of the primary, spent <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/self-funding-caruso-dominates-la-mayoral-ad-spending-rcna31622' target='_blank'>nearly $34 million</a> in that effort. Rep. Karen Bass, the second-place finisher who Caruso will face in November, spent a tenth of that amount.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Caruso’s success carries that asterisk that Boudin’s loss doesn’t. He made the runoff … but still has to win in a one-on-one contest. Los Angeles has nonpartisan elections, which may also have benefited Caruso’s candidacy. In November, both the larger electorate and Democrats coalescing around Bass may shift the order of finish. Boudin was likely similarly hurt by the nature of the election: low turnout overall, suggesting a more conservative electorate, with recall supporters more motivated to cast ballots.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These are all points of consolation for Democratic leaders on Wednesday morning, as will be Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handy defeat of a recall effort of his own last year. But they should not obscure from the broader problem. Democrats are in charge in Los Angeles and San Francisco and America broadly, given their control of the White House and Congress. And in all of those places, people have real concern about how things are going. One can point to extenuating circumstances or to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/pessimism-about-economy-is-about-both-partisanship-prices/?itid=ap_philipbump&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>subtleties of the data</a> or to the role of media in amplifying concerns. But the results in Los Angeles (Caruso made crime and homelessness a focus) and more directly in San Francisco reflect frustration with existing leadership that is likely largely independent of party.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The results in California on Tuesday may not portend a collapse of the Democratic Party over the long term. But they do reinforce the looming danger the party faces in November.</p>"

And they figure to feature prominently in the hearings that will be launched Thursday night by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>U.S. District Judge David O. Carter <a href='https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840.356.0.pdf' target='_blank'>ruled </a>that more of Trump lawyer John Eastman’s documents and emails must be turned over to the committee because they pertain to the probable crime and thus are not privileged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And in doing so, Carter offered a notable account of the plot. He said the “plan to disrupt the Joint Session” of Congress on Jan. 6 — the crime that he says probably was committed — “<a href='https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000181-4144-d2d5-abb1-f9c47cc00000' target='_blank'>was fully formed and actionable as early as December 7, 2020</a>.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The progression of the alleged plot remains somewhat shrouded, given that we don’t know all of what is contained in Eastman’s documents and that the revelation of the details has been piecemeal in media reports and in legal rulings such as Carter’s. But the alleged plot being “fully formed” as early as Dec. 7 would be significant.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The most detail we have comes from <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/15/another-lawyer-another-memo-offering-advice-stealing-presidency/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10' target='_blank'>Eastman’s memos</a> laying out ways on Jan. 6 to overturn the election. But the first of those memos reportedly was produced in late December. A Dec. 7 date would place the effort beginning significantly earlier. Indeed, it would have begun almost immediately after Eastman formally joined Trump’s legal team on Dec. 6. Formalizing that relationship carried benefits when it came to keeping certain communications and strategizing privileged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It would also suggest the plot might have predated efforts to create <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/significance-trumps-fake-electors-explained/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12' target='_blank'>alternative slates of so-called “fake electors”</a> for Trump on Dec. 14 that could be used to replace the official ones appointed for the electoral college and overturn the election. Carter also ordered Eastman to turn over documents related to efforts to meet with a group focused on what state legislatures could do to further the effort.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And, also important, as <a href='https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1534496183216898049' target='_blank'>Politico’s Kyle Cheney noted</a>, Vice President Mike Pence <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/30/pence-jan-6-legal-showdown-00021864' target='_blank'>on Dec. 7 asked for a briefing</a> from his legal counsel about his options when it came to certifying electoral college votes. Carter’s ruling would suggest that this requested briefing might have been a response to a “fully formed” plot emerging well before Jan. 6.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Carter doesn’t dwell upon precisely why he says the plot was “fully formed and actionable as early as December 7, 2020.” And that could be interpreted a number of ways. The evidence he cites is Eastman’s forwarding a memo that day that called Jan. 6 a “Hard Deadline” that was “critical to the result of this election.” He also refers to a Dec. 22 email in which a member of Trump’s legal team cites “the January 6 strategy,” which Carter interprets as meaning the eight recipients would have understood what that was.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But that doesn’t say precisely how much the strategy for Jan. 6 was fleshed out at that early date. It’s certainly something the Jan. 6 committee will be probing and providing detail on in the coming days and weeks.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The other key piece of Carter’s ruling that’s worth highlighting is an email on that same date — Dec. 22 — which is one of the emails he ruled Eastman must turn over. The judge says an unnamed lawyer actually argued <i>against </i>taking the Jan. 6 strategy to court, fearing an adverse ruling:</p><blockquote class='blockquote border-box black font--article-body pl-sm pl-md-ns bc-black b bl cb mb-md mt-sm-ns mb-lg-mod-ns'><div class='' data-qa='article-quote'>In the fifth email, dated December 22, 2020, an attorney goes beyond strategizing litigation outcomes. This email considers whether to bring a case that would decide the interpretation of the Electoral Count Act and potentially risk a court finding that the Act binds Vice President Pence. Because the attorney concluded that a negative court ruling would “tank the January 6 strategy,” he encouraged the legal team to avoid the courts. This email cemented the direction of the January 6 plan. The Trump legal team chose not to seek recourse in court — instead, they forged ahead with a political campaign to disrupt the electoral count.</div></blockquote><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This could be crucial. Certainly, the Trump campaign will have viewed the particular courts involved as being unfriendly to them. But, like previous evidence, including <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/heated-jan-6-email-exchange-between-trumps-pences-lawyers-annotated/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>Eastman’s discussions of disregarding the Electoral Count Act</a>, such an email could be read to show that the Trump campaign knew what it was doing might be illegal — or at least could be ruled as such by a court.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Carter summarized: “Lawyers are free not to bring cases; they are not free to evade judicial review to overturn a democratic election.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Expect all of this to be chewed over plenty in the coming days and weeks.</p>"

Every argument has some nuance; every proposal includes some asterisks. Both sides often see their position in absolute terms, a view that the other side is always quick to note ignores actual boundaries.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is, in other words, a debate that can defy simple categorization. In <a href='https://www.npr.org/2022/06/09/1103661684/gun-control-npr-pbs-marist-survey-uvalde-buffalo-biden' target='_blank'>a new poll</a> conducted by Marist for NPR and PBS NewsHour, though, the pollsters drew an interesting and useful line for considering the debate over guns and gun violence.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Respondents were asked which they felt was more important: protecting gun rights or controlling gun violence. It’s a simple dichotomy — admittedly more simple than the debate itself but one that allows for  gradation. Is it more important to protect the right of people to own guns, or is it more important to address the spate of firearm-related deaths in the United States?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Overall, Americans were more likely to say that controlling gun violence is more important, 59 to 35 percent. Among gun owners, as you might expect, protecting gun rights was the majority position, although only barely.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The biggest divide, in fact, wasn’t on gun ownership. It was by party. Democrats said that controlling gun violence was more important by a nearly 90-point margin. Independents said the same, more narrowly. Among Republicans, though, more than two-thirds said protecting gun ownership was more important — a higher level of support than even among gun owners themselves.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Other divides in the poll similarly align with partisanship. White Americans without a college degree — a heavily Republican group — are more likely to say that it’s more important to protect gun rights. So are Americans who live in rural areas, in part, it’s safe to assume, because they’re also more likely to own a firearm.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Given that the debate over gun violence is at this moment centered on the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Tex., it’s interesting to point out that people without children in the house more heavily prioritized controlling gun violence than did parents with young children at home. Less surprising is the gender divide, with men being more likely to say that protection of gun rights is more important than were women.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Marist asked the same question in <a href='https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/us130304/guns/Complete%20March%202013%20USA%20McClatchy_Marist%20Poll%20Tables.pdf#page=3' target='_blank'>2013</a>. At that time, the nation was about evenly divided in identifying which focus was more important. What has changed since then? Democrats have become far more likely to say that combating gun violence is more important.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Independents have flipped from being more likely to prioritize gun rights to focusing on controlling gun violence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What has changed since 2013? Polarization has increased, certainly. But so have the number of gun deaths in the United States. Gun violence has increased and mass shooting events, which tend to crystallize sentiment on gun ownership, have continued unabated.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The result is a broader sense that reducing gun violence should be considered more important than protecting the rights of gun owners — except among members of the party that controls half of the Senate and nearly half of the House.</p>"

And some new polls drive that home.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>An <a href='https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-gun-violence-in-the-united-states-june-2022/' target='_blank'>NPR/PBS/Marist College poll</a> released Thursday shows Biden with his lowest approval rating to date, at 38 percent. Similarly, a <a href='https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3848' target='_blank'>Quinnipiac University poll</a> released this week showed Biden tying his previous low of 33 percent. (Quinnipiac is often one of Biden’s worst polls.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But dig a little deeper and you’ll see something even more troublesome for Democrats: Biden looks to be a leader largely without a base of devoted supporters. Those who dislike him overwhelmingly feel strongly, but those who like him overwhelmingly … don’t.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>To wit:</p><ul class='font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list'><li class='pb-xs'><span>In the Marist poll, 40 percent “strongly” disapproved of him, while just 14 percent “strongly” approved.</span></li><li class='pb-xs'><span>In the Quinnipiac poll, 45 percent “strongly” disapproved, while just 15 percent “strongly” approved.</span></li><li class='pb-xs'><span>In the most recent NBC News poll, the margin was <a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22014966-nbc-news-may-poll' target='_blank'>45-16</a>.</span></li><li class='pb-xs'><span>In the most recent AP-NORC poll, the margin was <a href='https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AP-NORC-May-2022-Topline-Biden.pdf' target='_blank'>39-12</a>.</span></li></ul><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In three of these cases, it’s Biden’s worst margin to date.

And only once has a president seen three times as many people strongly disliking them as strongly liking them. It was George W. Bush in the waning days of his presidency — October 2008 — when at his low point, a stunning 58 percent strongly disapproved of him, while 7 percent approved.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Barack Obama bottomed out early in his presidency at 37 percent strongly disliking him, with 18 percent strongly liking him — a 2-to-1 ratio. Bill Clinton’s worst split was 31-13, also early in his presidency. And George H.W. Bush’s worst split was 24-12. (The latter two presided in a far less polarized time, in which you couldn’t could count on one-third or more of the country to strongly dislike the other side’s president at all times.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Which brings us to Donald Trump. Trump’s numbers were comparable to Biden’s, at certain points. But he faced stronger feelings both for and against. In a mid-2018 poll, 53 percent strongly disapproved of Trump, while 24 percent strongly approved.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It shouldn’t be surprising that Trump engendered more passion on both sides than Biden does. But that cuts both ways. Biden now has a predictably large portion of the country — 40-plus percent — that strongly dislikes him, which is pretty normal these days. But he doesn’t have the countervailing support from his base.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In recent polls, including the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in April, the percentage of Democrats who strongly approve of Biden has been between the mid-30s (34 percent in the Marist poll) and the mid-40s (44 percent in both the Quinnipiac and Post-ABC poll). In other words, a majority of Democrats don’t strongly approve of a Democratic president.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And that is also highly unusual. Trump never saw his “strong” support from his party drop below a majority. Obama saw something similar on a couple occasions, dipping into the low 40s for a couple months. And Bush wouldn’t get there until the final year-plus of his presidency.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>All of which poses a problem for Democrats in the midterms. Trump was at his worst on this question shortly before the 2018 midterms, in which his party lost the House. Ditto with Obama and the 2014 midterms, when he lost the Senate. And Bush was at his worst right before Republicans were drubbed in the 2008 presidential election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Democrats need to be asking themselves just what’s going to bring their voters out, given that most of them don’t see Biden’s presidency as something they strongly support. Perhaps they can be convinced that it’s just that important to prevent Republicans (and Trump) from retaking power. But it’s a much more difficult proposition.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Making things worse, Biden has been sliding into this position for a while now, with no signs that this is as temporary as it has been for his predecessors who have found themselves in comparable positions. Perhaps the slide will be arrested if inflation is alleviated. But that’s not something that happens overnight. And for now, there are no easy answers.</p>"

Paladino has long been an ally of Donald Trump’s and is a well-known name in New York business and politics. He recently announced his candidacy for New York’s 23rd Congressional District, quickly <a href='https://twitter.com/elisestefanik/status/1532820989633040385' target='_blank'>earning the endorsement</a> of House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But 16 months ago he was just Carl Paladino, a guy who called into local Buffalo radio shows. And who, without prompting, <a href='https://www.mediamatters.org/diversity-discrimination/carl-paladino-hitler-kind-leader-we-need-today-we-need-somebody' target='_blank'>offered praise</a> for Adolf Hitler.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the time, Gov. Andrew Cuomo was under fire, facing allegations of inappropriate conduct that would later lead to his resignation. Paladino was asked how to get the public engaged in advocating for change.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I was thinking the other day about somebody had mentioned on the radio Adolf Hitler and how he aroused the crowds,” Paladino said, according to audio unearthed by Media Matters. “And he would get up there screaming these epithets and these people were just — they were hypnotized by him. That’s, I guess, I guess that’s the kind of leader we need today. We need somebody inspirational.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He added that the state needed a “doer,” though it’s not clear if he was suggesting that Hitler was a “doer.” But, of course, noting Hitler’s oratory skills — and his use of epithets! — as a positive is sufficiently cringeworthy on its own.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A request for a response from the Paladino campaign was not received by the time of publication. Paladino did tweet this, however, soon after the Media Matters report was published.</p><div data-oembed-type='twitter' class='' style='min-height:171px'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>Proud to be ENDORSED by the Jewish Vote GOP for my run for Congress in New York's 23rd Congressional District! <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/NY23?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>#NY23</a> <br><br>Together we will SAVE AMERICA. 🇺🇸🇮🇱 <a href='https://t.co/gTU89YT7ST'>pic.twitter.com/gTU89YT7ST</a></p>— Carl Paladino (@CarlPaladinoNY) <a href='https://twitter.com/CarlPaladinoNY/status/1534923498581270529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>June 9, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async='' src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script>\n</div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This is not Paladino’s first demonstrated example of saying things that might prompt a sheepish response. In 2016, shortly after Trump won the presidency, Paladino <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/nyregion/carl-paladino-michelle-obama.html' target='_blank'>accidentally sent</a> a Buffalo publication a comment about then-first lady Michelle Obama that he claimed he had meant to send only to friends.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I’d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe,” he wrote, “where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I filled out the survey to send to a couple friends and forwarded it to them not realizing that I didn’t hit ‘forward’ I hit ‘reply,'” Paladino said at the time. “All men make mistakes.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Again, Paladino was not a candidate at the time of his interview in February 2021. But he’d been a candidate for governor in 2010 (<a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Carl_P._Paladino' target='_blank'>losing handily</a> to Democrat Cuomo) and was still involved in Republican politics. He was a member of the Buffalo school board … until <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/nyregion/paladino-ousted-buffalo-school-board-racist-comments.html' target='_blank'>soon after</a> the Michelle Obama incident. The standard for Americans generally is to be cautious about how and when one might praise Hitler, should you for some reason feel an urge to do so. For a well-known businessman and politician, the standard is far higher.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s hard to disentangle Paladino’s comment about Hitler’s appeal from his support for Trump and the drift of his party. Trump rose to prominence within the GOP specifically because of his ability to rile up audiences — often using epithets that reflected the anger of the far-right. In 2017, more than 4-in-10 Republicans expressed support for a system of government <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/10/actual-threat-posed-by-political-cult-america/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>predicated</a> on a strong leader unencumbered by legislative constraints, which is to say an autocrat or dictator who held power in the same manner as Hitler. Paladino didn’t express support for Hitler’s policies or for Nazi Germany’s political system, but he did note Hitler’s willingness to inflame his audiences with approval. To what end?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>I would not have thought this needs to be said, but apparently it does. There are not many people in human history for whom there’s no benefit in pointing out positive qualities, but the man who orchestrated the mass murder of millions of predominantly Jewish Europeans is one of them. The guy who triggered a global conflict between freedom and fascism at a cost of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers is not someone that it’s valuable to treat as having some useful skills. There are other people who did a good job of energizing populations than a man who also tried to murder a lot of that same population.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In other words, politicians, I would say this: You do not, under any circumstances, have to praise Adolf Hitler’s ability to rile up a crowd.</p>"

Kelley has denied entering the Capitol building itself.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Charging papers allege that Kelley waved a crowd up the stairway, and supported another rioter who pulled a metal barricade onto scaffolding that was holding up the stage for President Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Kelley “at approximately 2:05 p.m., used his hands to pull a covering off” the inauguration scaffolding, and “continued to gesture to the crowd, consistently indicating that they should move toward the stairs that led to the entrance of the U.S. Capitol interior spaces,” the charging papers state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a March 2021 interview with <a href='https://www.mlive.com/politics/2021/03/ryan-kelley-pushed-to-arrest-lawmakers-then-stormed-the-capitol-now-he-wants-to-be-michigans-governor.html'>MLive</a>, Kelley said: “I think that event was definitely an energizing event, right? ...

The following month, Kelley filed as a candidate for governor, framing his campaign as focused on election integrity following what he said was distrust of the 2020 Michigan election result.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kelley was considered a fringe candidate, but he has emerged atop polls of the remaining candidates in the race. He continues to focus on alleged election fraud.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“So many people around the state from all areas of the state are not happy with how the 2020 election turned out,” Kelley has said, vowig to nullify the state’s voting machine contracts on his first day in office. “There are so many questions here that we need to get rid of these machines,” Kelley said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>President Biden won Michigan by about 155,000 votes out of nearly 5.5 million cast.

At the same event, another Republican candidate urged the crowd to bring guns to polling places. “Lock and load” when you come to vote, said Mike Detmer, a state Senate candidate. The remarks were captured on video that was circulated widely on social media.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A real estate agent, Kelley made a name for himself in politics in 2020 as an outspoken critic of Whitmer’s decision to lock down the state to prevent the spread of covid-19. He was a lead organizer and public face at protests outside the Capitol. Several people later arrested in a plot to kidnap Whitmer attended those protests, including two that had been hired to provide security as Kelley and others spoke. Two of the men charged in the plot <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/04/08/michigan-whitmer-verdict-governor/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>were acquitted at trial; the jury deadlocked</a> on charges against the other two.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After the speeches ended at one anti-lockdown protest, Kelley was among members of the crowd that filed into the Capitol and banged on the door of the legislative chamber.

That’s true; it was.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But that was not its sole mandate. Instead, the committee was formed (according to the verbiage of <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/503/text' target='_blank'>the resolution</a> that created it) to “investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex ... and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.' That included consideration of “the influencing factors that fomented such an attack on American representative democracy while engaged in a constitutional process.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee’s task, then, is both to understand what happened at the Capitol that day and <i>how</i> it happened, writ broadly. It is to probe the riot as a health inspector might a murder: figuring out what happened at the scene but also the motives and methods that led to the crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And while understanding the failures that allowed the Capitol to be breached and the riot to occur is important, it is as or more important to understand the struggle that led to it. The riot was simply the culmination of a lengthy process aimed at subverting the election results, the most stark manifestation of the push to keep President Donald Trump in power.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We need to learn why Capitol police were overwhelmed. But we need more urgently to understand how Trump and his allies sought to steal the election and how to counteract a national misinformation effort that even today has millions of people seeing Trump as the rightful winner of the 2020 election. We need to know not only where the weak points in the Capitol were but where the weak points are in our democracy.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This is not only within the committee’s scope but it follows a prominent precedent. The 9/11 Commission explained how the 2001 terror attacks in New York and Washington unfolded — but also, <a href='https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-911REPORT/pdf/GPO-911REPORT.pdf' target='_blank'>at length</a>, the rise of al-Qaeda and how Osama bin Laden came to power and developed his plan for the attack. It was an exploration of the acute moment that arrived on Sept. 11 of that year but also of the underlying systems that failed to interrupt what bin Laden hoped to accomplish. It recognized the attack not only for what it was but as a point where extremism, global politics and our national defenses intersected.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s obvious why the response to the committee’s work has included criticisms about the specifics of what’s being examined. Calls for an examination of how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) purportedly failed to ensure that the Capitol was safe are in part an effort to shift blame for the attack from Trump to Pelosi and in part to more explicitly focus any examination on the very tight bounds of Capitol Hill from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. on that day. If those six hours in that place are the near-exclusive mandate of the committee, it definitionally leaves Trump out of consideration.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We know that the committee’s work is broader than that. We know it’s been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/28/committee-investigating-jan-6-attack-issues-subpoenas-14-bogus-trump-electors-states-biden-won/?itid=lk_inline_manual_15' target='_blank'>probing</a> the effort to appoint duplicate slates of electors in swing states. We know that it has subpoenaed people involved in Trump’s aborted effort to overhaul the Justice Department to bolster his false claims of rampant fraud. We know that others who faced pressure to accede to Trump’s effort to steal the election, like Georgia secretary of state <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/08/brad-raffensperger-testify-jan-6-committee-00038325' target='_blank'>Brad Raffensperger</a> (R), might offer public testimony. None of these things led to the riot; instead, each sits alongside it, paths that Trump hoped would lead to a second term in office but which truncated before he reached that destination.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This is important. It is important for there to be a review of everything that happened after polls closed on Nov. 3, 2020 (and, really, in the months prior where Trump was already planting seeds of skepticism). It’s why people like Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) treat the committee’s work seriously. Cheney was not hostile to Trump, <a href='https://www.axios.com/2021/05/16/liz-cheney-trump-2020-capitol-attack' target='_blank'>voting for him</a> in 2020 even as he obviously prepared to challenge the results. Now she helps lead the commission’s efforts specifically because she thinks it is important. Her isolation from the rest of the Republican Party <i>followed</i> her willingness to treat the investigation of Trump’s efforts seriously. She did not join the committee because Republicans were undermining her; they’re undermining her because she joined the committee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One of the most insightful comments to emerge on Jan. 6, 2021 came from The Atlantic’s David Graham.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Remember what today was like,” he <a href='https://twitter.com/GrahamDavidA/status/1347036797247905794' target='_blank'>wrote</a>. “Someone might try to convince you it was different very soon.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee hopes to revive that sense of despair, fear and anger, the one that others have been happy to see ebb. It will probably present new facets of the Capitol riot that spur some of the same visceral reaction Americans felt then across party lines. It clearly hopes to then transition that anger and frustration to the broader effort of which the riot was simply one endpoint.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The riot was the deadliest, largest, most visible, most alarming, most unnerving part of Trump’s effort to steal the election. But it was only part of it.</p>"

His home in Allendale was searched by the FBI on Thursday morning.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kelley was released from custody Thursday afternoon after a brief initial appearance in federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally J.

The remarks were captured on video that was circulated on social media.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A real estate agent, Kelley made a name for himself in politics in 2020 as an outspoken critic of Whitmer’s decision to shut down the state to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. He was a lead organizer and public face at protests outside the Capitol. Several people later arrested in a plot to kidnap Whitmer attended those protests, including two that had been hired to provide security as Kelley and others spoke. Two of the men charged in the plot <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/04/08/michigan-whitmer-verdict-governor/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36' target='_blank'>were acquitted at trial; the jury deadlocked</a> on charges against the other two.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After the speeches ended at one anti-shutdown protest, Kelley was among members of the crowd that filed into the Capitol and banged on the door of the legislative chamber.

But election officials concede they will count otherwise valid ballots where the date is obviously wrong, such as reflecting the voter’s birth date or even some date in the future.

But he contended the federal law “does not address that issue. It applies only to errors or omissions that are not material to the question whether a person is qualified to vote.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.) aiming to strike a handshake deal in the coming days that would allow a bill to pass Congress by the end of the month. Among those who have objected are the No. 3 Senate Republican leader, John Barrasso (Wyo.), and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a prominent conservative leader in the House.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Barrasso said Thursday that “there is no role of the federal government for red-flag laws,” ruling out even a federal program that would merely encourage rather than mandate them. “Wyoming is never going to pass one, and it is a state’s decision,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Speaking on the House floor Thursday, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/08/house-gun-legislation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8' target='_blank'>moments before</a> lawmakers there passed a red-flag bill, Jordan questioned “why Republican senators are pushing this” and “trying to bribe states to implement this.” He said, “We know what this thing is going to look like and how it’s going to violate due process. I hope they will come to their senses and stand up for the law-abiding American citizens and their fundamental liberties and vote this thing down.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A sustained conservative backlash threatens to upend a cornerstone of the Senate negotiations, which have been underway for roughly two weeks but have yet to produce a deal. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) have led talks over the red-flag measure, which would likely involve establishing federal grants and standards to encourage states to set up their own laws.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There are 19 states along with the District of Columbia that have laws in place allowing authorities, and sometimes private individuals, to seek red-flag orders, which are also known as extreme risk protection orders. While the laws differ in their details, they generally allow petitioners to ask a judge to issue a temporary order allowing authorities to seize the firearms of individuals or prevent them from purchasing new ones if they are found to constitute a threat to themselves or others.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Gun rights groups have consistently opposed the laws at the federal and state levels, calling them a backdoor effort at gun confiscation that does not afford due process and could be easily abused. The National Rifle Association, for instance, <a href='https://www.nraila.org/articles/20220602/the-nra-opposes-laws-to-judicially-nullify-second-amendment-rights' target='_blank'>said this month</a> that laws already proposed in Congress “trample on individual rights.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The laws enjoy broad public support, according to <a href='https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-gun-violence-in-the-united-states-june-2022/' target='_blank'>recent surveys</a>. A Marist Poll taken after the May 24 shooting inside a Uvalde, Tex., elementary school found that 73 percent of Americans back red-flag laws, including 60 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of gun owners.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House on Thursday voted 224-202 to pass a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/08/house-gun-legislation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_15' target='_blank'>red-flag bill</a>, with five Republicans voting in favor and one Democrat opposed. Ahead of the vote, Republican leaders urged their members to oppose the bill, calling it “poorly crafted legislation focused on firearm confiscation and undermining the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The bill combined a measure incentivizing states to create their own laws with a more divisive bill that would allow family members or law enforcement officials to seek red-flag orders in federal court. Under that bill, a judge could immediately issue a 14-day restriction if he or she finds the person in question “poses a risk of imminent personal injury to self or another individual.” A longer-term order would necessitate a hearing with the subject of the order.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>State laws have differing due process standards, and the Senate negotiators have been seeking to work out those details to the satisfaction of a critical mass of Republicans. Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.), <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3480/text' target='_blank'>who m</a>ur the House measure incentivizing states to act, said similar legislation would “provide the foundation” for a Senate deal. “They are considering a few other things that are a little bit more challenging to get consensus on, but the red-flag bill is one that they seem to have more consensus,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But conservatives appear intent on undermining that consensus. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said Thursday that states were free to pursue red-flag laws if they wish, but “this should not be something Congress needs to meddle in.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Daines, who is seeking to chair the Senate Republican campaign committee for the 2024 election cycle, added, “Many of our states are swimming in money right now after we shoveled $7 trillion of covid money out the door, so money is not the issue. The states can do this if they think it’s the best thing they should be doing.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Other conservatives who voiced opposition included Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), who noted a red-flag law in New York did not prevent the May 14 mass shooting in a Buffalo supermarket that left 10 dead, as well as Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), who called any red-flag provision a “poison pill” for any Senate deal. “I don’t see how a red-flag law passes up here,” he said. “I think it’s an infringement on the Second Amendment, and just like I’m standing up and fighting to protect our freedoms of speech and our freedoms of religion, I’m going to stand up and protect our Second Amendment.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The top negotiators, Murphy and Cornyn, meanwhile, signaled that they considered the red-flag component of their negotiations very much alive. “I think we’ve got a diversity of opinions in the Republican caucus, but my sense is there is still a lot of support for state red-flag bills and federal support for the proper and constitutional implementation of those of those laws,” Murphy said Thursday. Cornyn separately added, “There’ll be something on that, but not a national red-flag law.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Murphy declined to say whether a bipartisan deal without a red-flag element would be substantial enough to be worth passing. Negotiators are also discussing expanding federal background checks for gun buyers to incorporate juvenile records, providing billions of dollars in new mental health funding and additional measures to beef up school security.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va), another member of the negotiating group, said it was “a no-brainer to me” to include a red-flag provision. “I feel very strongly that it would be great if we could to address that, and it has to be addressed somewhere,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Other Republicans involved in the negotiations gave an upbeat assessment as well, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who said he supported federal support to states “if that preserves due process and if we made sure the rights of individuals are respected,” and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who cited the Florida red-flag law backed by Republicans there as a model. “It’s not mandatory. It’s optional,” he said. “Anybody who says that there’s a significant opposition to what we’re talking about right now, I just don’t see it in my discussions.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>With negotiators hoping to pick up support from not just the minimum of 10 Republican senators, but potentially 20 or 30, the fate of the provision may lie with those such as Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), another member of Republican leadership who said she was awaiting more detail and that it was “going to come down to definitions” because “everybody has a different thing in mind.” She said, “Right now, the discussions are so broad, we haven’t really narrowed down onto anything. But I think the positive thing, the takeaway from all of this, is that people have a pretty open mind.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>Paul Kane contributed to this report.</i></p>"

We have enormous resources, and a democratic spirit that stands for freedom and opportunity for everybody.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Biden’s exclusion of the authoritarian regimes of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua from the summit faced vocal criticism, as a handful of foreign leaders spoke out against the decision to not invite all nations. John Briceño, the prime minister of Belize, said the summit belongs to “all of the Americas” and that it was “inexcusable” that some countries were barred from attending. The influence of the gathering, he said, was “diminished by their absence.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It is incomprehensible that we would isolate countries of the Americas which have provided strong leadership and contributed to the hemisphere on the critical issues of our times,” Briceño said. He later added: “Geography, not politics, defines the Americas.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Argentine President Alberto Fernández also noted <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/05/11/us-americas-summit-boycott/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9' target='_blank'>the controversy,</a> saying through an interpreter that he was sorry not all countries that should have attended were present. Fernández, like Briceno, was critical of the decades-old U.S. embargo of Cuba, and he noted that Venezuela has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We definitely would have wished for a different Summit of the Americas. The silence of those who are absent is calling to us,” Fernández said, proposing that the host country not exclude nations from future summits. “President Biden, I am sure that this is the time to open up in a fraternal fashion in order to pursue common interest.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Once he concluded, Fernández shook Biden’s hand and the two men spoke briefly.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The comments created an uneasy tension with Biden’s efforts to start a new day in intra-American relations after the presidency of Donald Trump, who openly disdained international alliances. This is the first time the United States has hosted the Summit of the Americas since 1994.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think we are a far cry from what we saw from a previous American administration,” Biden said, outlining joint efforts in health care, migration, climate and jobs. “That’s what our people expect of us,” he said. “It’s our duty to show them the power of democracies to deliver when democracies work together.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The question of democracy’s future in many ways hung over the conference. While Biden shut out Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, some of the leaders he did invite, such as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, have themselves been accused of anti-democratic actions. Biden even held a one-on-one meeting with Bolsonaro on Thursday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And while Biden painted a future for the Western Hemisphere as a beacon of democracy, many human rights advocates say it has in fact been moving in the opposite direction, with an erosion of democracy in a number of countries.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Vice President Harris, who also attended the summit, has been personally taking on the corruption in the countries of the Northern Triangle — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — that has spurred many of their residents  to try to flee to the United States.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As he closed Thursday’s session with other leaders from the Americas, Biden downplayed the disputes.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Notwithstanding some of the disagreements relating to participation, on the substantive matters what I heard was almost unity and uniformity,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Still, Biden’s affirmation of the virtues of democracy has been sorely tested this week. Ahead of the summit, the White House rolled out new initiatives intended to promote its objectives of the summit, such as a new investment in hundreds of thousands of health-care workers throughout the region and increased cooperation on climate change.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The final day of the summit, Friday, is expected to focus on migration challenges, an effort that has been led in the Biden administration by Harris.  The president has tasked her with focusing on the root causes of migration, such as poverty and corruption, that prompt thousands of Latin Americans to leave their countries in hopes of a better life in the United States.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But many of the administration’s objectives were overshadowed by a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/06/mexico-president-snub-biden/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29' target='_blank'>high-profile snub</a> from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has objected to the United States’ decision to exclude the trio of regimes that the administration concluded were in direct conflict with the democratic principles Biden wanted to promote this week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The White House has described Biden’s decision as one rooted in conscience that reflects a central theme of his presidency — that the world is seeing a broad clash between democracies and autocracies, and that it is important to take the side of democracies. After López Obrador declared his boycott of the summit, the White House announced that he had been invited to visit Biden in Washington next month.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The president’s principled position is that we do not believe that dictators should be invited,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But some human rights advocates argue that the administration’s embrace of democratic principles is not entirely consistent. A “Summit for Democracy” that Biden convened in December included some countries with spotty records, such as Pakistan.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And the current furor has erupted at a time when the White House is preparing for a potential Biden visit next month to oil-rich Saudi Arabia as the United States faces soaring gas prices, despite the Saudi crown prince being accused of orchestrating the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi four years ago. Biden had long vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah nation, but he faces enormous pressure to increase the world fuel supply and contain rising gas prices.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And despite his exclusion of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, the president has faced criticism domestically from Republicans over summit invitations, including from Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who said Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, whom the United States recognizes as the country’s legitimate leader, should have been directly invited to attend. Instead, Biden and Guaidó spoke on the phone Wednesday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden’s formal remarks Thursday were sandwiched between meetings with two foreign leaders that were a veritable split screen of Biden’s foreign policy ethos: first, a sit-down with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, a model of democracy that Biden seeks to promote around the world, then later with Bolsonaro, an authoritarian leader who just this week questioned the validity of the 2020 U.S. presidential election that Biden won.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Bolsonaro was an avid supporter of Trump during the 2020 campaign, and he did not congratulate Biden on his victory until more than a month after his decisive win.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>With Trudeau, Biden admiringly said that the United States has “no better friend in the whole world.” The Canadian prime minister said the two countries are working in tandem to promote democratic ideals and that doing so is “better for citizens, for putting food on the table and putting futures in front of them.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A few hours later, Biden sat down with Bolsonaro, marking the first time the two men have met or even spoken. In brief remarks to reporters, the Brazilian leader, who is up for reelection in October, said in Portuguese that he “came to office through democracy and I’m quite certain when I leave office it will also be through democratic means.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Underlining the broader threat to democracy, the summit unfolded as a select House committee Thursday held its first public hearing on the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by supporters of former president  Trump trying to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>White House officials have said Biden would try to watch some portions of the hearing, although his schedule is complicated by the summit obligations in California.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“As I said when it was occurring and subsequently, I think it was a clear, flagrant violation of the Constitution,” Biden said ahead of his sit-down with Trudeau. “I think these guys and women broke the law, tried to turn around the result of an election. And there are a lot of questions about who is responsible and who is involved. I’m not going to make a judgment on that.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Regarding the hearing itself, he added, “a lot of Americans are going to see for the first time some of the details.”</p>"

The American people deserve answers. So I come before you this evening not as a Democrat, but as an American who swore an oath to defend the Constitution,” Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) said as he opened the hearing. . “Our work must do much more than just look backwards. Because our democracy remains in danger. The conspiracy to thwart the will of the people is not over.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“January 6th was the culmination of an attempted coup,” he said. “A brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after January 6th, ‘to overthrow the government.’ The violence was no accident. It represented Trump’s last, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power. And ultimately, Donald Trump — the president of the United States — spurred a mob of domestic enemies of the Constitution to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The session was scheduled to open with two witnesses expected to recall their harrowing experiences at the Capitol: Caroline Edwards, a U.S. Capitol Police officer seriously injured as pro-Trump rioters forced their way into the building and Nick Quested, a British filmmaker who embedded with and documented the activities of an<b> </b>extremist group, the Proud Boys, was also due to testify.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards sustained a traumatic brain injury during the attack and is believed to be the first officer who was injured during the insurrection.

The footage has provided crucial evidence to the committee’s investigation and the Justice Department’s criminal probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Court filings have previously detailed a meeting, captured on camera by Quested, that occurred between Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers, on Jan. 5 in an underground parking garage in downtown Washington. The recording “at one point, picked up audio of a person referencing the Capitol,” according to a court filing. Tarrio <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/06/tarrio-proud-boys-seditious-conpiracy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_19' target='_blank'>was indicted </a>on a federal charge of seditious conspiracy, along with four top lieutenants, on Monday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The goal is to show that the extremist groups were not acting spontaneously but instead executing an organized and preplanned strategy when they surged up the stairs of the Capitol building and crashed through doors and windows, disrupting Congress’s usually routine ceremony to count the votes of the electoral college and declare a new president. The committee likewise intends to demonstrate that the extremist groups<b> </b>were inspired by Trump’s rhetoric and tweets, as well as by the sprawling efforts of the former president and his close allies to overturn the election, including an unprecedented effort to pressure Vice President Mike Pence, presiding over the session, to toss out electoral college votes for Biden.</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans sought this week to cast the committee as partisan and illegitimate. Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), the Republican conference chair, argued on Wednesday that the hearings are designed to distract voters from other issues such as inflation and crime, and called them “a smear campaign” against Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a Thursday<b> </b>statement, Trump went further, once again saying falsely that the election was “rigged” but also seemingly embracing the events of the violent day. “January 6th was not simply a protest, it represented the greatest movement in the history of our Country to Make America Great Again,” he wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some Trump aides have cooperated with the committee’s investigation, but others refused — as did some Republican House members, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Two former aides — Peter Navarro and Stephen K. Bannon — <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/steve-bannon-indicted/2021/11/12/eebd4726-43fa-11ec-a3aa-0255edc02eb7_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>have been charged</a> with criminal contempt by the Justice Department for their refusals to cooperate despite receiving subpoenas.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>While the nine-member committee is bipartisan, the panel’s two Republicans are both fierce Trump critics.

A committee aide — who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly — said Thursday’s hearing will feature “a whole lot of new material — unseen material” including video and audio obtained during the investigation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/politics/cnn-poll-democracy/index.html' target='_blank'>CNN poll</a> in February found that 65 percent of Americans characterized the Jan. 6 attack as either a “crisis” or a “major problem” for the country.

As the committee prepared to meet Thursday, the Justice Department <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/09/ryan-kelley-arrested-michigan-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32' target='_blank'>announced the arrest</a> of a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan, Ryan D. Kelley, on misdemeanor charges related to his participation in the Jan. 6 riot, a reminder that numerous GOP candidates for office participated in protests in Washington on Jan. 6 and even more harbor Trump’s myth that the election was stolen.</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee’s investigation is ongoing as well, a committee aide told reporters. Hearings are also scheduled for Monday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week. A hearing next week is scheduled to focus on Trump’s pressure campaign to persuade Pence to halt or delay the electoral certification of Biden’s win.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Greg Jacob, Pence’s then-chief counsel, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/heated-jan-6-email-exchange-between-trumps-pences-lawyers-annotated/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'>argued</a> with Trump attorney John Eastman, who had produced a legal analysis designed to persuade Pence to use his position overseeing the congressional count to block Trump’s defeat.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A federal judge this week ordered Eastman to share more emails and documents with the Jan. 6 committee — including an email that U.S. District Judge David O. Carter ruled showed evidence that Trump aides had by early December 2020 developed a political strategy to use the ceremonial counting of the electoral college votes on Jan. 6 to overturn the election. Carter said that plan might constitute a crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Other hearings are expected to focus on how Trump used the vast levers of presidential power to subvert the election, including a failed plan to oust the then-attorney general, who had said there were no signs of fraud in the 2020 election, and replace him with an ally who would say the opposite. The committee is also expected to focus attention on security lapses that left the U.S. Capitol Police out-personed and out-equipped by the surging mobs.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A committee aide suggested that video of interviews with senior White House officials, senior Trump administration officials, campaign officials and Trump family members would be part of the hearings.

Here are three early takeaways from the first of a series of hearings, after nearly a year of investigation. We’ll update this as the hearing continues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.” That is the top Republican on the committee (and one of only two who agreed to participate with Democrats), Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) directly laying the blame for the violence on Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“[W]hen a president fails to take the steps necessary to preserve our union or worse causes a constitutional crisis,” she said, “we’re at a moment of maximum danger for our republic<i>.”</i></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney said that over the next month, the committee will present evidence that Trump made not a single call to the Department of Defense or other national security agencies during the attack. The committee played testimony from Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying that it was Vice President Mike Pence who made those calls.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee said it will present evidence that the president “refused for hours to do what his staff, his family and many of his other advisers begged him to do, immediately instruct his supporters to stand down and evacuate the Capitol.” He also yelled at advisers who told him to act, the panel said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And, perhaps most damning, the committee said that he cheered on the protesters’ most violent tendencies. Cheney said, “Aware of the rioters chanting to ‘hang Mike Pence,’ the president responded with this sentiment ‘Maybe our supporters have the right idea. [Mike Pence] deserves it.’”</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Much of this has been corroborated <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/jan-6-insurrection-capitol/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13' target='_blank'>by earlier reporting</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It was always going to be a challenge for the committee to focus the public’s attention on an event from more than a year ago — and to do it over a series of hearings for a month. On Thursday, it laid out exactly how it will try to tell the story of the Jan. 6 attack and who was responsible for it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee opened by seeking to jolt the American public back to that violent day with never-before-seen footage of the attackers marching up to the Capitol and smashing windows to get in, overwhelming Capitol Police officers. “We can’t hold this there are too many f------g people. Look at it from this vantage point. We’re f----d,” one officer says.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Monday, the committee will share how they think Trump tried to steal the election, though he knew he had lost. “President Trump ignored the rulings of our nation’s courts,” Cheney said. “He ignored his own campaign leadership.” They played video of Trump’s attorney general, William P. Barr, who told the committee he resigned in the final month of the administration in part because Trump was trying to wrestle his way to stay in power: “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit,” Barr said.</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Wednesday, it will detail how Trump “corruptly planned” to replace top Justice Department officials with his own allies, who wanted to endorse investigations of baseless election fraud claims in states like Georgia. (After <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/durbin-report-trump-pressure-justice/2021/10/07/b51712d4-2769-11ec-8d53-67cfb452aa60_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>they threatened mass resignations</a>, he did not end up replacing them.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Later, the committee will spend a significant amount of time on the pressure Trump and his allies put on Pence to overturn election results on that day, something Pence himself said was “wrong.” They’ll also talk about how Trump “corruptly pressured” state legislators and election officials to change election results, and will shed new light on the Trump campaign’s efforts to set up slates of false electors in states he’d lost.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Finally, the committee will revisit the day of the attack, accusing Trump of having “summoned” right-wing groups to attack the Capitol, then resisting calls by his allies and family to tell the attackers to go home. And in Cheney’s words, after the attack, White House staff feared that Trump “was too dangerous to be left alone.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s a lot for the committee to tackle — all while keeping Americans’ attention span over a long period of time. But the first hearing was objectively riveting, weaving together startling footage of that day — including congressional staffers running for their lives as attackers breached the Capitol — with live testimony from a Capitol Police officer badly injured in the attack and a documentarian who embedded with the Proud Boys.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Top Republican lawmakers — even Pence, whose life was threatened by the attackers — have spent the year and a half since the attack downplaying what happened. It’s now <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/us/jan-6-attendees.html'>a badge of honor in some circles</a> to have been in D.C. protesting election results or to be labeled an insurrectionist.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) compared those who have justified what happened to those who defended slavery and the civil war.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I’m from a part of the country where people justify the actions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan and lynching,” Thompson said in his opening remarks, his Southern drawl evident. “I’m reminded of that dark history as I hear voices today try to justify the actions of the insurrectionists<i>.”</i></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And Cheney, whose party has isolated her for her strong criticism of Trump and willingness to serve on this committee, said,<i> “</i>Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible. There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also shared new information: A number of Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), asked the White House for pardons in the weeks after the attack, for their alleged involvement in trying to overthrow the election. The committee <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/10/jan-6-congress-testify/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>subpoenaed</a> Perry, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and several other House Republicans, who refused to cooperate with their investigation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We will update this story with the latest news as the hearing continues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p>"

Setting the tone was a chilling compilation of never-before-seen video of a mob surging into the building, including new security footage of aides scattering in fear inside the office of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a Trump ally.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That was followed by two witnesses who testified live to their<b> </b>harrowing experiences at the Capitol that day. Caroline Edwards, a U.S. Capitol Police officer seriously injured as pro-Trump rioters forced their way into the building, described the scene as “carnage.” Nick Quested, a British filmmaker who embedded with and documented the activities of an<b> </b>extremist group, the Proud Boys, and said he watched “the crowd turn from protesters to rioters to insurrectionists.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The violence was no accident,” Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) said as he opened the hearing. “It represented Trump’s last, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power. And ultimately, Donald Trump — the president of the United States — spurred a mob of domestic enemies of the Constitution to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a statement punctuated by clips from testimony gathered so far by the committee — including from close Trump aides and his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner — Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) promised that the committee would explain in the coming weeks Trump’s multi-prong strategy to subvert democracy and remain in power despite losing the election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>According to snippets of testimony played by Cheney, Trump’s attorney general, William P. Barr, told Trump his claims were “complete nonsense.” Ivanka Trump was persuaded by the assurance. “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying,” she told the committee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Even so, Cheney said Trump tried to use the resources of his office, including the Justice Department, to overturn the vote, then pressured Vice President Mike Pence to toss out electoral college votes for Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021. Once violence erupted, she said Trump not only failed to act to quell it — but instead cheered on the mob.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Aware of the rioters’ chants to ‘hang Mike Pence,’ the president responded with this sentiment: ‘Maybe our supporters have the right idea,’ ” Cheney said. “Mike Pence ‘deserves’ it.' ”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney, whose decision to join Democrats on the investigative panel has earned her a serious primary challenge and Trump’s enmity, offered stern words to her fellow Republicans who have dismissed the committee’s work: “I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible — there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The evening’s most dramatic moments belonged to Edwards, a police officer who has not before told her story in public. She described in vivid detail confronting extremists at a bicycle rack that had been blocking a wide sidewalk leading to the Capitol. The crowd threw her to the ground, knocking her unconscious. She sustained a traumatic brain injury during the attack and is believed to be the first officer who was injured during the insurrection.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When she came to, she recalled seeing another officer sitting nearby, holding his head in his hands: Brian D. Sicknick. He was, she said, “as pale as this piece of paper,” holding up a blank sheet that had been sitting on a table in front of her. Sicknick was taken to the hospital and later died; <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/brian-sicknick-death-strokes/2021/04/19/36d2d310-617e-11eb-afbe-9a11a127d146_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>a medical examiner ruled</a> he died of natural causes after suffering strokes but that the events of that day contributed to his condition.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It was “just a war scene,” she said, with injured officers surrounding her. “They were bleeding, they were throwing up, I was slipping in people’s blood,” she said. “It was carnage, it was chaos. I can’t even describe what I saw. Never in my wildest dreams did I think as a police officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the hearing’s conclusion, Edwards shared an extended embrace with Sicknick’s partner, Sandra Garza, who had been seated in the front row in the committee room.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In all, 140 police officers were assaulted that day. Five people died in the Jan. 6 attack or in the immediate aftermath.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>She said that on Jan. 6 and in the days after, she was called “a traitor to my country, my oath and my Constitution.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“In actuality, I was none of those things,” she said. “I was an American standing face to face with other Americans asking myself many times, many, many times how we had gotten here.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans sought this week to cast the committee as partisan and illegitimate. Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), the Republican conference chair, argued on Wednesday that the hearings are designed to distract voters from other issues such as inflation and crime, and called them “a smear campaign” against Trump. As the hearing unfolded, the Twitter account for Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee tweeted images of violence during Black Lives Matters protests in 2020. “All. Old. News,” the Republicans tweeted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a Thursday<b> </b>statement, Trump went further, once again saying falsely that the election was “rigged” but also seemingly embracing the events of the violent day. “January 6th was not simply a protest, it represented the greatest movement in the history of our Country to Make America Great Again,” he wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some Trump aides have cooperated with the committee’s investigation, but others refused — as did some Republican House members, including McCarthy. Two former aides — Peter Navarro and Stephen K. Bannon — <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/steve-bannon-indicted/2021/11/12/eebd4726-43fa-11ec-a3aa-0255edc02eb7_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_33' target='_blank'>have been charged</a> with criminal contempt by the Justice Department for their refusals to cooperate despite receiving subpoenas.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>While the nine-member committee is bipartisan, the panel’s two Republicans are both fierce Trump critics. McCarthy (Calif.) pulled his handpicked members from the panel last year after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) vetoed two of his picks.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee hoped to use the tightly edited, previously unseen video and audio clips to  provide a compelling and newsy account of the day and remind Americans of the danger posed to democracy by the Trump-supporting mob.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee utilized video shot by Quested and his crew, who spent Jan. 6 and the months leading up to the assault with leaders of the Proud Boys, which <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/canada-proud-boys-terrorist-capitol-siege/2021/02/03/546b1d5c-6628-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_38' target='_blank'>Canada has designated</a> as a terrorist group. The footage has provided crucial evidence to the committee’s investigation and the Justice Department’s criminal probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It included a meeting, captured on camera by Quested, that occurred between Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers, on Jan. 5 in an underground parking garage in downtown Washington. The recording “at one point, picked up audio of a person referencing the Capitol,” according to a court filing. Tarrio <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/06/tarrio-proud-boys-seditious-conpiracy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39' target='_blank'>was indicted </a>on a federal charge of seditious conspiracy, along with four top lieutenants, on Monday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The goal was to show that the extremist groups were not acting spontaneously but instead executing an organized and preplanned strategy when they surged up the stairs of the Capitol building and crashed through doors and windows, disrupting Congress’s usually routine ceremony to count the votes of the electoral college and declare a new president.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee<b> </b>likewise sought to demonstrate that the extremist groups<b> </b>were inspired by Trump’s rhetoric and tweets, as well as by the sprawling efforts of the former president and his close allies to overturn the election, including an unprecedented effort to pressure Pence, presiding over the session, to toss out electoral college votes for Biden.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/politics/cnn-poll-democracy/index.html' target='_blank'>CNN poll</a> in February found that 65 percent of Americans characterized the Jan. 6 attack as either a “crisis” or a “major problem” for the country. But <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/03/slight-majority-say-trump-should-be-charged-with-crime-over-jan-6-role-poll-finds/?itid=lk_inline_manual_44' target='_blank'>a Washington Post-ABC poll</a> in May found more split opinion about the work of the House committee, with 40 percent of Americans reporting the panel is conducting a “fair and impartial” investigation of the events surrounding the attack and 40 percent say the committee is not.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>More than 800 people have been charged with criminal activity in connection with Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department, including over 250 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. As the committee prepared to meet Thursday, the Justice Department <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/09/ryan-kelley-arrested-michigan-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_46' target='_blank'>announced the arrest</a> of a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan, Ryan D. Kelley, on misdemeanor charges related to his participation in the Jan. 6 riot, a reminder that numerous GOP candidates for office participated in protests in Washington on Jan. 6 and even more harbor Trump’s myth that the election was stolen.</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee’s investigation is ongoing as well, a committee aide told reporters. Hearings are also scheduled for Monday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week. A hearing next week is scheduled to focus on Trump’s pressure campaign to persuade Pence to halt or delay the electoral certification of Biden’s win.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Greg Jacob, Pence’s then-chief counsel, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/heated-jan-6-email-exchange-between-trumps-pences-lawyers-annotated/?itid=lk_inline_manual_49' target='_blank'>argued</a> with Trump attorney John Eastman, who had produced a legal analysis designed to persuade Pence to use his position overseeing the congressional count to block Trump’s defeat.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A federal judge this week ordered Eastman to share more emails and documents with the Jan. 6 committee — including an email that U.S. District Judge David O. Carter ruled showed evidence that Trump aides had by early December 2020 developed a political strategy to use the ceremonial counting of the electoral college votes on Jan. 6 to overturn the election. Carter said that plan might constitute a crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Other hearings are expected to focus on how Trump used the vast levers of presidential power to subvert the election, including a failed plan to oust the then-attorney general, who had said there were no signs of fraud in the 2020 election, and replace him with an ally who would say the opposite. The committee is also expected to focus attention on security lapses that left the U.S. Capitol Police outnumbered and out-equipped by the surging mobs.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Closing her remarks, Cheney referenced a painting that hangs in the Capitol Rotunda, depicting George Washington voluntarily relinquishing power by resigning his commission in the Continental Army, a sign of his desire to peacefully transfer power.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The sacred obligation to defend this peaceful transfer of power has been honored by every American president,' she said. “Except one.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>Isaac Stanley-Becker, Rachel Weiner, Mariana Alfaro, Matthew Brown and Amy Gardner contributed to this report.</i></p>"

This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A banner on the screen read: “THE JANUARY 6TH ‘SHOW TRIAL’ IS UNDERWAY.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Live coverage of the hearing was relegated to Fox’s far-less-watched sister channel, Fox Business Network, where two Fox News anchors weighed in during a break. Bret Baier reflected on a video compilation of the riot shared by the committee: “It does bring up the thoughts and feelings of that day,” he said. “It was heinous. It was dark.” </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I don’t think there was a lot of new ground that was really pushed here,” said co-anchor Martha MacCallum. She questioned why the hearing did not explore the death of Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter shot and killed by a police officer as she stormed the Capitol. </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Most networks stuck with a fairly austere presentation, adding few of the whiz-bang touches that decorate their election nights and other live events. Some offered a smidgen of newsy graphics, such as a bullet-pointed bio of committee Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). There were few attempts at instant-synthesis: Instead of a newsy, updating chyron, ABC mostly just bannered “Attack on the Capitol: The Investigation” across the bottom of the screen. </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The careful tracking of the hearings extended to the occasional bursts of vulgarity revealed in testimony and documents “Thanks to your b---s---, we are now under siege,” Cheney read aloud, unbleeped, in an email written on Jan. 6 from a counsel to then-vice president Mike Pence to a legal adviser for Donald Trump. </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Only when the committee took a break did the screen images vary much from channel to channel.

Sicknick, who engaged with rioters on Jan. 6 and died the following day.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On CNN, viewers heard from Chris Wallace, the veteran Fox anchor who left the network late last year, and later said it was in part because of Carlson’s efforts to downplay Jan. 6 or promote a conspiracy-minded view of it as a “false flag” event. He commended the hearing as “a very powerful, well-produced presentation,” with special attention to the riot footage: “They don’t lose their capacity to shock and horrify you,” he said. “This is a mob breaching the walls of the citadel.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On NBC, host Chuck Todd told anchor Lester Holt that the hearing had provided “the investigation we didn’t get to have in the second impeachment.” Compared to most Trump-era hearings, he said, “this one truly has the receipts. This connects the dots.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>They remained unconvinced at Fox News, though, where MacCallum and a fellow news anchor engaged more directly with the substance of the hearing, after the opinion shows were done at 11 p.m.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Did this move the needle at all?” asked Shannon Bream, wondering about undecided or wavering voters. </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I kind of doubt it,” responded MacCallum.</p>"

Edwards was knocked violently backward, suffering a concussion that affects her still. Then the mob moved to the next line of police defense, and Edwards did too, continuing the struggle.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It was something like I had seen out of the movies,” Edwards told the committee and a prime-time national television audience during testimony that was both gripping and gut-wrenching. “I couldn’t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground they were bleeding. They were throwing up. … I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people’s blood.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>With her testimony, Edwards, 31, became for many the first police face to appear on a national stage to discuss the viciousness of the attack on the Capitol. She was one of about 140 Capitol and D.C. police officers who were injured in the riot. Other officers have testified previously, but not on this stage — the first of multiple public hearings being orchestrated by the committee as it seeks to build a case that former president Donald Trump and his allies conspired to carry out a coup.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House committee interwove her responses to Rep. Liz Cheney with video taken from various sources, and Edwards provided plenty of clear recollections of how the mob approached her, insulted her, bullied her, and eventually powered its way up to the Capitol.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards joined the Capitol Police in 2017, after beginning her career in public relations. She is from Atlanta and graduated from the University of Georgia.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards was one of the first officers to come forward and criticize her own department for its lack of preparation, speaking as a member of the officers’ union.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In February 2021, Edwards told USA Today that officers in her division had asked commanders on Jan. 5, 2021, about handling armed rioters, and was told there was no plan. She told the newspaper that she was riot-trained but was deployed without equipment, a common problem for Capitol Police officers that day. One school bus packed with riot gear was locked and couldn’t be opened by frenzied officers, an investigation later disclosed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards also noted that Capitol Police leadership did have warnings about the pending storm, but didn’t inform the front-line officers. Although Deputy Chief Yogananda Pittman told Congress that there was “a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target,” officers weren’t prepared and help wasn’t summoned quickly enough.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In her testimony Thursday night, Edwards recounted how a group of Proud Boys, wearing orange knit hats, approached her and four other officers at the Peace Circle barricade. None of the officers wore protective gear. She named Joseph Biggs, a Proud Boys leader facing federal seditious conspiracy charges, as one person who confronted her and stirred up the crowd.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards recalled the huge mob turning on the police and hurling insults, prompting her to suggest to a colleague that they call for reinforcements.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I know when I’m being turned into a villain, and that’s when I turn to my sergeant,” she said. “And I stated the understatement of the century. I said, ‘Sarge, I think we’re going to need a few more people down here.’”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The gathering crowd began to press against the barricades, and the video played by the committee showed the officers struggling to hold on to the bike racks.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards said one of the bike racks struck her in the head, and she can be seen on the video falling onto one of the stone steps.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I felt the bike rack come on top of my head and I was pushed backward, and my foot caught the stair behind me and my chin hit the handrail, and at that point I had blacked out, but the back of my head hit the concrete stairs behind me,” she recounted to the committee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When she regained consciousness, Edwards said “adrenaline kicked in” and she rushed to support other officers who had been pushed back by the rioters.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The video showed her glancing over at her colleague, officer Brian D. Sicknick, who had apparently been sprayed in the face with an irritant. Then Edwards was sprayed in the face as well. Sicknick would later suffer two strokes and die.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“When I fell behind that line … I can just remember my breath catching in my throat because what I saw was just a war scene,” Edwards said. “It was carnage. It was chaos.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Edwards began her testimony with a tribute to her grandfather, a Marine who was wounded in the battle of Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War, and that he “answered the call at a great personal cost.” She said “he lived the rest of his days with bullets and shrapnel in his legs, but never once complained about his sacrifice. I would like to think that he would be proud of me. Proud of his granddaughter that stood her ground that day and continued fighting even though she was wounded, like he did many years ago.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When she was done testifying, Edwards and Sicknick’s longtime partner, Sandra Garza, shared an extended embrace. Lawmakers on the panel approached the front line of officers who bore witness to the insurrection — and the hearing — and expressed gratitude for their service and presence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>Isaac Stanley-Becker and Jacqueline Alemany contributed to this report.</i></p>"

The network has been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/course-fox-news-isnt-airing-jan-6-committee-hearings/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2' target='_blank'>all-but-completely ignoring</a> the subject for 17 months; skipping this hearing was a continuation of a pattern, not a break from one. But it nonetheless announced that coverage would be shunted to Fox Business and the network’s streaming platform, and it shrugged at the various scoldings that followed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When 8 p.m. Eastern rolled around, though, it became clear that the network wasn’t simply going to not cover the hearing. Instead, it began more than two hours of commercial-free rebuttal. It didn’t simply cover other things, it focused almost entirely on the hearing as though it was former president Donald Trump’s defense team — without, of course, showing its audience the prosecution’s case.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Part of that was probably timing. The hearing began just as Tucker Carlson’s show kicked off, and few people in America have been more energetically engaged than Carlson in casting the Jan. 6 riot as not worthy of discussion. Or as largely innocuous, save for some vandalism. Or maybe it’s a government false flag aimed at <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/28/tucker-carlson-movie-white-nationalist/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6' target='_blank'>casting Republicans as racists</a> or something. Rhetorical consistency is not Carlson’s strength, but that is happily for him not a limitation for his job.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So Carlson began by crowing about Fox’s decision to stand apart from its competitors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The whole thing is insulting. In fact, it’s deranged,” Carlson said. “And we’re not playing along. This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live. They are lying, and we’re not going to help them do it.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Yes, God forbid that Fox News should air an hour of propaganda or dishonesty. Carlson didn’t articulate the purported lies, which he couldn’t have,  because the hearing hadn’t actually begun by that point. But it didn’t matter, because his audience wasn’t hearing the evidence from the hearing anyway. Was it a lie when the hearing showed William P. Barr, Trump’s ever-loyal attorney general, describing Trump’s voter-fraud claims as nonsense? Doesn’t matter, just wave it all away as untrustworthy without actually explaining what was said and why it couldn’t be trusted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>How did Carlson’s show go? He transitioned quickly into his frustration that the committee wasn’t addressing the <i>real</i> questions, in his estimation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“What did happen, exactly, on Jan. 6? What’s the truth of that day?” Carlson said. “Well, that’s still unknown. From the extensive video we have of Jan. 6, it’s clear that some in the crowd, more than a few, were encouraging protesters to breach the Capitol. To commit felonies.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And here we go. You may recall that Carlson spent numerous episodes last year claiming that the riot was a function of FBI instigators, people easily identified as such thanks to their appearing as unindicted co-conspirators in federal charging documents. But that was nonsense: Both because FBI embeds <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/16/tucker-carlsons-tinfoil-hat-theory-blaming-fbi-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>wouldn’t be identified in that way</a> and because some of those co-conspirators were easily identifiable. One was obviously the wife of a man charged for his role in the riot; when Carlson later hosted the couple so that they could complain about their persecution, no one mentioned that Carlson had previously called the woman a secret federal agent. Carlson, of course, never corrected his falsehood.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If you’re wondering whether Carlson would have the temerity to reintroduce his most infamous allegation about the insurrection, he did.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“In the case of a man called Ray Epps, we know his name, but they’ve never been charged,” Carlson said of the people in the crowd allegedly instigating violence. Epps didn’t actually do that; he was on video the night before saying that people should go into the Capitol the following day — but he didn’t urge the Capitol breach on Jan. 6 itself. Thanks to an article from a right-wing website run by a former Trump administration official removed from his position for ties to white nationalists, Epps became a target of rabid attacks from Carlson and others that alleged he was a federal agent. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/06/another-effort-distance-trump-jan-6-crumbles/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>He wasn’t</a>. But, months after that became clear, here’s Carlson trying to imply that Epps was some nefarious figure, even comparing Epps — who isn’t known to have broken any laws — with the Michigan gubernatorial candidate arrested <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/09/ryan-kelley-arrested-michigan-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>this week</a> for his alleged role in the Capitol riot.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over the course of the hour, there were no commercials, nor were there commercials in Sean Hannity’s hour that began at 9 p.m. No reason was given for this, although Carlson did mention that unusual pattern toward the end of his show. Why not air commercials? Well, one reason would be to keep people glued to Fox News — and therefore not changing the channel to a network that was showing the hearing.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>For much of the show, the hearing was shown on-screen as Carlson and his guests spoke over it. Often, the view was not of the committee members, witnesses or the video display at the front of the hearing room. Instead it was often a shot of the audience. One NBC News producer went back after the fact and <a href='https://twitter.com/mannyfidel/status/1535091397614870539' target='_blank'>synced Carlson’s show</a> with what was being shown in the hearing room. During footage showing rioters breaking into the Capitol, Fox switched to the camera showing the audience. When the hearing showed information that didn’t need sound, Fox more than once cut away from it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Not having commercials meant having more guests. And what a lineup! A who’s who of the Carlsonverse. The Federalist’s Sean Davis. Former Hawaii  congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Fox News’s favorite Democrat. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the Conservative Political Action Coalition, recently <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/23/that-american-right-hopes-emulate-hungary-is-telling/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25' target='_blank'>back from Hungary</a>. Young Turks reporter <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/04/did-rep-maxine-waters-shove-a-reporter-you-decide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25' target='_blank'>Michael Tracey</a>. And, at the end of the hour, Darren Beattie — the guy booted from the Trump administration who wrote that first Ray Epps story.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Beattie encouraged viewers to have their friends go to his website and read his allegations about a federal false-flag operation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Tell them to look you in the eye and say that the feds weren’t involved in this,” Beattie said. “It’s a clear hoax. We know what’s happened, but there’s unfinished business and we need to expose the feds for what they’ve done.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He and Carlson agreed that there were questions that weren’t being asked. But, Carlson assured his viewers at another point, everyone knew why the riot occurred: because people had simple questions about the election! Like that Joe Biden got 10 million more votes than Barack Obama??? How could that happen??? (<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/22/actually-it-makes-perfect-sense-that-biden-would-get-more-votes-than-obama/?itid=lk_inline_manual_30' target='_blank'>Population growth and anger at Trump</a>, but you probably knew that.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But this is what Fox News spent the hour doing. In a break from simply not informing its audience about the riot and the effort by Trump to block Biden’s election, the network decided instead to actively promote an obviously wrong alternate assessment of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/jan-6-insurrection-capitol/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31' target='_blank'>what happened at the Capitol that day</a>. It hyped doubt about the election results, promoted debunked conspiracy theories and ironically cast the committee’s work as lies and propaganda.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Fox News didn’t ignore the hearing, as expected. Its audience would have been better served if it had.</p>"

On Friday morning, Trump denied on Truth Social, his social network, that he said he supported hanging Pence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I NEVER said, or even thought of saying, ‘Hang Mike Pence,’” he wrote. “This is either a made up story by somebody looking to become a star, or FAKE NEWS!”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s opening statement helped set the tone on a presentation that served as a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/10/jan6-committee-hearings-biden/?itid=lk_inline_manual_23' target='_blank'>blunt reminder</a> of the vicious violence unleashed by the mob that day.

Thompson (D-Miss.) said at the start of the hearing. “It represented Trump’s last, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power. And ultimately, Donald Trump — the president of the United States — spurred a mob of domestic enemies of the Constitution to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy.”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump vented to those around him about Pence as he watched on television as rioters besieged the Capitol, The Post previously reported. Minutes after Pence and his family were endangered by the pro-Trump mob and forced to flee the Senate chamber, Trump tweeted that the vice president lacked “courage.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,” Trump wrote. “USA demands the truth!”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump has continued to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/31/trump-pence-overturned-election/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_30'>falsely claim</a> that Pence had the authority to overturn the 2020 election during Congress’s counting of electoral college votes, which he did not.

In fact, he was told this by one of his campaign’s data experts, as his aide Jason Miller told the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot. Trump should have known that this wasn’t weird or conspiratorial since there was plenty of reporting on the way in which vote-counting would unfold. He should have been aware that his polarizing presidency would inspire as many people to vote for Biden as it did to vote for him.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>All of that was sitting out there for objective observers to consider. Trump wanted to win and hoped he’d win and then he didn’t. The truth of the matter was that he lost.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But it’s not clear if Trump recognized that truth. He’s given little indication that he did, insisting without pause since November 2020 that the election was stolen from him. Even when that data expert explained that he had no path to victory, Miller claims, Trump objected, <a href='https://twitter.com/JasonMillerinDC/status/1535057581865316353' target='_blank'>arguing</a> that he was “looking at purely from what those numbers were showing as opposed to broader things to include legality and election integrity.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There was the truth of the matter ... and then there was Trump’s way of considering that truth. The numbers said he wouldn’t win, but what about the court challenges. Then the court challenges failed so the “what about” shifted: what about various non-credible claims about fraud? What about the court’s failure to do its job? Wasn’t the truth clearly subject to further exploration?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Since Trump first came down the escalator seven years ago next week, the question of truth has been of enormous importance in American politics. His candidacy and presidency elevated the salience of simply acknowledging what was real and his presidency culminated in a violent effort to supplant reality with falsehoods.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At this point, even truth is politically polarized.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Truth, belief and knowledge all intermingle in a complicated way. Knowledge, philosophers have argued, is a belief that is both true and justified. Does Trump know that the election was stolen? No, since it wasn’t (it isn’t true). What’s more, he has no justification for believing it was — at least no <i>valid</i> justification for it. Perhaps the most crucial question is whether he even believes that. In the seemingly unlikely event that the question of Trump’s responsibility for the Jan. 6, 2021 riot progresses to the point of criminal charges, prosecutors would <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/08/new-erosion-trumps-defense-against-criminal-prosecution/?itid=lk_inline_manual_15' target='_blank'>need to show that he didn’t</a>, that the various points at which he was told that he would lose or had lost had convinced him despite what he said publicly.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Since the election, Trump’s false claims about the result have been labelled “the big lie.” Lying sits at the other end of the spectrum of accuracy from truth, but the two terms are not opposites exactly. Lying isn’t simply saying something false; it’s saying something false <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/24/why-the-media-wont-say-donald-trump-is-lying/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>with the intent to deceive</a>. So not every Trump supporter is lying about the election results: many of them sincerely believe that the election <i>was</i> stolen. They believe what Trump and his allies in the conservative media said about fraud and about the trickiness of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/02/ludicrous-effort-pretend-that-increasing-voter-turnout-is-nefarious/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>encouraging more people to vote</a>. They are the targets of the lie, not its drivers. But then we come back to Trump: if he actually believes the election was stolen — however he came to that belief, even if through a sense of deluded self-preservation — is he himself lying?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>You can see how the verbiage very quickly stops mattering beyond being a thought experiment for future sophomore-level philosophy courses. What matters is that Trump has spread misinformation about the election without pause since only a few hours after it ended and that millions of Americans believed him. That’s what struck me, watching the video footage of violence at the Capitol aired during the House committee’s hearing on Thursday night: thousands of people absolutely furious about what they saw as an election that had been stolen — because people they believed were telling them the truth insisted it had been.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This, in fact, was the argument made by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson as he <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/10/fox-news-didnt-just-ignore-jan-6-hearing-it-did-something-worse/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>worked to distract</a> the network’s viewers from the committee’s findings: those people were furious because they thought the election was stolen. He meant this as a way to exonerate the rioters and others at the scene but what he did instead was indict himself and Trump. He was among those who tried to elevate questions about the legitimacy of the election (as he did on Thursday as well). The rioters were motivated by a belief that they thought was true so therefore it’s the people who fostered that false belief who are culpable for what followed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What’s crucially important is that there’s been no effort since Jan. 6 to correct that belief. For a few hours or days in the wake of the riot, outer-ring Trump allies appeared to waver, expressing some concern about what the president had been doing and saying. But the political and emotional cost of challenging that belief was too high and the rewards of catering to it large enough that the effort quickly collapsed. Trump was muffled by his removal from social media but he and his team have nonetheless pressed forward, backing and amplifying a scattershot campaign of sowing doubt about the election results, more than a third of the way into President Biden’s term. The only factor that isn’t in place now that was in place on Jan. 6 is a reason for thousands of angry people to be in the same place at the same time.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump, of course, never backed away from his false claims about the election. Maybe he believes it, as defense attorneys might one day try to argue in a court of law. Perhaps he didn’t or doesn’t, as <a href='https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10200733/Alyssa-Farah-says-Trump-admitted-lost-2020-election-advisers-convinced-otherwise.html' target='_blank'>other advisers</a> have asserted and as seems most likely to be the case. But for us it doesn’t matter.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What matters is he keeps pressing the case, keeps elevating non-true assertions that his supporters continue to accept as true. What matters is that he and his allies keep attaching balsa-wood buttresses to the dishonesty, making it seem ever more stable even as it remains on the brink of collapse. Perhaps you could have convinced someone in December 2020 that Trump’s claims were false. But now there’s an entire cinematic universe of intertwining false claims that tie it all together, a Gordian knot immune to any swords.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Even in the wake of the House hearing, Trump was adding threads, disparaging <a href='https://twitter.com/meridithmcgraw/status/1535232226090156034' target='_blank'>even his own daughter</a> as not knowing what she was talking about as she accepted the truth of Trump’s election loss.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>His conduit for sharing those thoughts was the Twitter clone he helped launch earlier this year, named “Truth Social.” Posts on the network are called “truths,' even the false ones.</p>"

It was skillfully and wisely presented for an American audience that hasn’t been paying attention to every news development or investigation stemming from the incomprehensible Capitol assault of Jan. 6. An audience that, for a multitude of reasons, may have been tuned out.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And it was horrifying. Can anyone who heard U.S. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards testify before the House select committee Thursday night ever forget her account of slipping in blood as she struggled through hours of hand-to-hand combat with her own countrymen who were calling her a traitor? I can never forget hearing her say these six words: “It was carnage. It was chaos.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So, yes: Riveting. Horrifying. But strangely, for me, at least, the hearing was also heartening — and even inspiring. The material was awful to behold, but these two hours, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/06/10/fox-cnn-networks-jan-6-hearing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5' target='_blank'>presented by every broadcast TV network without interruption during prime time</a>, radiated something simple and deeply important: the truth.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This truth was intertwined with a genuine quest for accountability. Such a quest may be futile. But that doesn’t make it any less crucial.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>For a couple hours on Thursday evening, I felt something that — amid the brutal onslaught of recent mass shootings, including in my hometown of Buffalo — I haven’t felt in a while. Deep pride in being American and at least some slight hope that our nation might be able to right itself.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In general, the news media’s handling of the hearings was a positive part of this. I made it a point to watch the hearing on the three broadcast networks, starting out with CBS and changing occasionally to ABC and NBC. The cable-news audience, after all, is largely spoken for; they’ve already made up their minds.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That Fox did not air the hearings on its main channel is no surprise. It’s deplorable, and the final piece of evidence if anyone needed one, that the “News” part of that network’s name is just more propaganda that <a href='https://twitter.com/MattNegrin/status/1534881889869303808' target='_blank'>no one should indulge.</a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If<i> this</i> hearing wasn’t newsworthy on a strictly empirical basis, what could possibly be? The hyped-up coverage of a “caravan” of migrants moving toward the southern border?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The broadcast networks, I figured, were the place where open-minded and perhaps even undecided Americans might stumble across the hearings and be struck by the raw evidence of that day’s carnage and chaos, where they might be forced to confront proof of the former president’s culpability.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The network anchors — Norah O’Donnell at CBS, Lester Holt at NBC and David Muir at ABC — did well. They may not have the full gravitas or trust that Walter Cronkite commanded in an earlier era, but all have developed a strong relationship with the audiences of their nightly newscasts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>For the most part, these news anchors simply got out of the way of the hearing, but by their somber demeanor they communicated that this was something of crucial importance. I didn’t hear every word on every network, but I heard no effort to downplay what had happened on Jan. 6 or to give equal time to liars and election deniers. That was refreshing.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The whole presentation and the coverage of it came off as serious, accessible, clear, and driven by mission — to tell the truth. The networks, as far as I could tell, did not shy from allowing their audiences to hear the profanity of Trump’s longtime loyalist, former Attorney General Bill Barr, when he described the claims of significant election fraud and a rigged outcome: “It was bulls---.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The audience was warned, several times, that there would be disturbing images and explicit language, but they were not shielded from it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>To their credit, the networks decided to treat Americans as sentient grown-ups. They did not indulge in what NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen sarcastically described, in reference to Fox’s appalling decision, as the <a href='https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1534203665468248066' target='_blank'>public’s right <i>not</i> to know.</a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A <a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-capitol-attack-cbs-news-poll-analysis/' target='_blank'>CBS News poll</a> suggests that some Americans could be affected by what they see in these hearings.

And there is much more to come.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Friday morning, with the truth casting its essential light, things felt just a tiny bit less grim.</p>"

She teased the investigation’s biggest findings and sharply criticized her fellow Republicans for the roles that they played — including enabling and continuing to support Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“There will come a point when Donald Trump is gone,” Cheney said, “but your dishonor will remain.”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These hearings, which <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/06/january-6-committee-hearing-schedule-how-to-watch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10' target='_blank'>continue Monday</a>, could mark the pinnacle of Cheney’s political career or the end of it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The former  rising star of the GOP has already been alienated by party leaders, abandoned by longtime supporters and  consistently attacked by Trump and his allies, who are backing a primary challenger Cheney will face in August. While most of the nine other <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/01/what-happened-10-house-republicans-who-voted-impeach-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11' target='_blank'>Republicans who voted to impeach Trump</a> after Jan. 6 have either decided not to run for reelection or mostly avoided discussing the former president, Cheney has made her role as the vice chair of the select committee investigating the insurrection central to her pitch to voters. She is trying to convince them she’s on the right side of history — and that her Trump-free approach to conservatism is the right one.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“These issues around what happened on January 6th and around Donald Trump and the danger that he poses, those matter to every American,” Cheney told supporters at a campaign event in Cheyenne, Wyo., on Saturday. “And I just feel very strongly about my responsibility.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In more than 20 conversations with lawmakers, political operatives, foes and friends of the Wyoming Republican, they uniformly describe her as obstinately and surgically focused on extinguishing Trump from the modern conservative movement that he has largely redefined in recent years, with little introspection regarding the forces bigger than Trump that facilitated her ousting from the Wyoming Republican Party  earlier this year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney has said the deadly assault of the U.S. Capitol crossed the party line for her and that she has a nonpartisan duty to set the record straight for the people who were “betrayed and lied to” by Trump. Cheney participated in several private meetings with GOP leaders in the days leading up to the attack and was in the House as insurgents tried breaking down the doors, helping other lawmakers put on gas masks because tear gar has been deployed nearby.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Democrats run the select committee, but they deferred to Cheney — the daughter of a former Republican vice president they still revile — at the opening hearing to methodically lay out the case against Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“She’s had a huge head start on the rest of the committee in understanding these events, because she knows the players and understands the internal political culture of the GOP — this is very familiar terrain for her,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s Republican colleagues have struggled to understand her motives, especially given the political price she is paying in Wyoming, where Trump celebrated his largest margins of victory. Some wonder whether she is angling to run for a higher office.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has told others that he understands Cheney’s position, but “it’s the only thing she cares about,” according to one adviser. “That doesn’t help anyone.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Cheney after her impeachment vote that he would try to protect her if she would drop the Trump<b> </b>attacks, but she declined, people familiar with the matter said. He has privately described her as “obsessed” with Trump and with destroying his political power, they said. Cheney has repeatedly criticized <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/27/mccarthy-trump-audio-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>McCarthy for going to Mar-a-Lago</a> to see Trump soon after the attack, helping the president’s public redemption.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney explained her motives in personal terms at the Saturday campaign event, pointing to Jan. 6 as the moment she realized the peaceful transfer of power was no longer a guarantee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I looked at my boys in the weeks after January 6th; it became very clear that we might suddenly have to question that,” Cheney said.<b> </b>“And I am absolutely committed to do everything I can do, everything that I am required and obligated to do to make sure that we aren’t the last generation in America that can count on a peaceful transition of power. It is hugely important.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Days before the opening hearing, Cheney stood in Cheyenne’s Old West Museum, surrounded by 19th-century horse carriages, and told a small crowd of supporters and warned that Trump “can’t be anywhere close to that power again.” The crowd of about 70 supporters included mostly traditional Republicans, including a few who supported her father’s first campaign more than 40 years ago, as well as some independent-leaning voters.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“What we do in Wyoming is going to matter so much,” she said. “I cannot overstate how much what we do is going to matter, because it’s going to matter from the perspective of our democracy as a whole. It’s going to matter. People are going to watch Wyoming.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Wyoming’s Aug. 16 primary, Cheney faces <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-cheney-hageman-primary/2021/09/08/8723142e-069c-11ec-8c3f-3526f81b233b_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>Harriet Hageman</a>, an attorney and former Republican National Committee member whose campaign is guided by Trump advisers. The former president attended a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/29/trump-wyoming-cheney/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>large rally for Hageman in late May</a> and has claimed that “the people of Wyoming  cannot stand” Cheney.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney advisers describe the race as a difficult one, and Trump has claimed the congresswoman is lagging in the polls. Cheney has held back her vast campaign war chest but last week began what is expected to be a massive TV ad campaign that makes only indirect reference to “standing up to bullies.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>She has not been able to hold large, publicized campaign events, partly for security concerns, and is instead gathering dozens of supporters at a time and then using her digital media team to blast video snippets of the event out to supporters around the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney, 56, has long had a complicated relationship with Wyoming. She attended middle school in the state but mostly grew up in the Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia. Her father, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/january-6-cheney/2022/01/06/72665baa-6f1e-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_41' target='_blank'>Dick Cheney</a>, went from junior White House aide to the youngest presidential chief of staff ever, for Gerald Ford, before returning to Wyoming and winning the state’s sole House seat in 1978.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Liz Cheney’s political viewpoint was formed in her<b> </b>father’s orbit of conservative hawks, particularly once he became secretary of defense in 1989 and then George W. Bush’s vice president. She worked as a State Department deputy assistant secretary focused on Middle East affairs, at a time when wars were launched in Afghanistan and Iraq. She embraced the belief popular among many neoconservatives that all people yearned for democratic governance freed from their autocratic regimes, justifying U.S. military action in many parts of the world and leading Trump to derisively label her a “war monger.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the Obama administration years, Cheney began to carve her own identity, particularly as an acid-tongued partisan commentator on Fox News who belittled the White House. In 2013, she tried to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/11/23/five-realities-of-liz-cheney-vs-mike-enzi/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45' target='_blank'>challenge Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.)</a> but withdrew from the race amid an angry backlash. She then ran for her father’s former House seat in 2016 and won, saying her star power would help the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tim Stubson, a former state representative who lost to Cheney in 2016 but now supports her, said he recalls Cheney saying: “I have a national voice. I have a national presence. I can use that for the benefit of the state of Wyoming.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“That was her pitch,” Stubson said. “And that’s exactly what she did.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Cheney was first running for office, Trump became the party’s presidential nominee.  Stubson remembers her carefully embracing most of Trump’s conservative policies but not his outrageous behavior — later<b> </b>earning her praise from Trump’s family members and senior advisers at a fundraiser in the Wyoming resort town of Jackson in 2019.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump won the state by 46 percentage points in 2016 — slightly better than Mitt Romney did in 2012 — and then by 43 percentage points in 2020.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over that time, Wyoming’s Republican Party has been slowly taken over by conservatives who identify more as Trump supporters than Republicans. The state party is now led by Frank Eathorne, a member of the Oath Keepers who stood on the Capitol’s West Front during the insurrection, walkie-talkie in hand. Cheney has heavily focused on investigating his role, advisers say.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This [takeover] was planned over several years, very organized and very dedicated,” said Joe<b> </b>McGinley, a former Natrona County Republican Party chairman who runs a medical practice in Casper, Wyo. “And they had a long-term goal to take first, the county parties, then the state party, then the legislature, and then all of the other elected positions.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Earlier this month, a group of breakaway Republicans held a candidate forum that included loud heckling of an incumbent state representative wearing a mask — his immuno-suppressing medications make him susceptible to severe outcomes if he develops covid — and even more jeering when he said the state government should accept federal funding, the largest source of state revenue. A long-shot candidate for governor parked his campaign truck, with the motto SOVEREIGN WYOMING painted across the front, outside the event.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>With so many voters tilting in this direction, McGinley believes Cheney’s best hope is to attract a pool of new voters for the primary — soft Republicans who do not normally participate in primaries, as well as some crossover votes from independents and Democrats who<b> </b>can register as Republicans up until the day of the Aug. 16 primary. That, however, could require a major shift in Cheney’s current message. Many of those soft Republican voters, according to McGinley, need to be drawn out on local issues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This is not about President Trump,” McGinley said. “This is about Wyoming. This is about Wyoming needs. This is about Wyoming jobs. Wyoming is struggling under the Biden administration with oil and gas under attack and coal under attack.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some in Wyoming say Cheney hasn’t been as visible as she was in the past, and even advisers and allies wish she was campaigning more, although others note there are concerns about her safety and the reaction of some voters in parts of Wyoming.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s work on the committee has helped her develop a national following and<b> </b>raise a record $10 million for this election so far, with almost $7 million in the bank, a figure that has probably grown over the past two months.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney raised more than $7.2 million last year, an astonishing amount for a state with fewer than 600,000 residents, according to Open Secrets, an independent political funding analyst. A little more than $200,000 came from Wyoming donors, <a href='https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/03/donors-from-outside-of-wyoming-make-up-the-majority-of-rep-liz-cheneys-record-breaking-fundraising-during-the-2022-election-cycle/' target='_blank'>according to the analysis </a> — a statistic her opponent has loudly advertised.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Bobbie Kilberg, a prominent Virginia donor, held a fundraiser for Cheney in a hotel ballroom earlier this year. It was moved from Kilberg’s home because so many people wanted to attend<b> </b>after the Republican Party censured Cheney and announced it would not support her reelection, she said, and 212 people raised $532,000. The crowd included Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Joe McCain, the brother of the late senator John McCain of Arizona.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“There are a lot of Republicans, quiet Republicans who don’t like confrontation, who have had it,” Kilberg said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the event, she said, Cheney offered a fiery denunciation of Trump and his behavior.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“She talked at the fundraiser about respect for the constitution, the rule of law. She said that Donald Trump had not adhered to any of that — his behavior was inexcusable — people had to stand up, and people had to be accountable,” Kilberg said. “She did not shy away in any manner shape or form in her feelings or beliefs that Donald Trump had not respected the rule of law.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A person involved with the Hageman campaign said Cheney could triumph if Democrats decide to cross over in large droves. Still, Cheney faces a problem of basic math. In the last midterm elections, about 115,000 people voted in the GOP primary, while 17,000 voted in the Democratic primary.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If it’s 20 percent, we’re okay; if it’s 30 percent, it gets closer,” the person added, trying to predict how many Democrats will ultimately cross over. For their part, Cheney’s team has not tried to go after crossover voters, according to people familiar with their strategy.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the crowd at Cheney’s Saturday campaign event was Harmon Davis, 75, a retired pulmonologist who didn’t support her in 2016 because he considered her “a carpet bagger” who wasn’t familiar with the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Davis described when he had a change of heart: “When she started to behave like a thinking, courageous leader, and was able to not have to swallow the party politic and was able to speak her mind about things, and to stand up.” </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Cheney seems to have lost many more supporters, including Doug Cooper, a Wyoming rancher who volunteered for her original campaign, held a dinner for her team at his house and had her cellphone number. He now plans to vote for Hageman.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Until Jan. 6, I was pleased with what she was doing, but she has put all her political assets against Trump. It’s a bad deal,” Cooper said. “I feel that she’s really a traitor to us. … I went from an ardent supporter to as strong an opponent as you can find.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cooper said Trump was right to raise questions about the validity of the 2020 election results and said Democrats deserve some of the blame for the Jan. 6 attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s two mortal sins, he said, were voting to impeach Trump and then continuing to criticize him. Cooper said he had tried to email emailed Cheney directly about his concerns but didn’t hear back, and had repeatedly talked to her staff repeatedly about his concerns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Trump is wildly popular in Wyoming,” he said. “She’s alienated herself from a large portion of the Republican Party. Liz has got a problem.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Despite Cheney’s continued conservative convictions — just look at her voting record — she has become somewhat of a hero to liberals who have contributed to her campaign or commended her courage for joining the Jan. 6 committee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>She has received mostly rave reviews from her Democratic colleagues, who describe her as one of the most aggressive members. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who invited Cheney to be on the committee and appointed her as the vice chairwoman, described the Republican’s leadership as “excellent.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) called her “very smart, very hard-working, thoughtful.” Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.) said there are “few people in Congress I can think of who I enjoy working with more than Liz.”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That doesn’t mean that her new Democratic friends have deluded themselves into believing that Cheney’s now a Democrat. She’s been less “liberated,” according to a person involved with the investigation, and more constrained by her belief system than the other Republican on the committee, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who is retiring from Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It’s been great working with her, but we don’t agree on many, many other issues, as I’m sure you know,” Lofgren said. “She’s a conservative, and I’m not.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney did not want the committee to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/05/20/ginni-thomas-arizona-election-emails/?itid=lk_inline_manual_80' target='_blank'>investigate Ginni Thomas</a>, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, according to people involved with the investigation. Cheney did not think it was fair to target the justice without evidence that he was involved, according to those involved, but some Democrats instead saw this as an effort to protect her hardcore Republican credentials. Cheney has also clashed with Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) over how much to focus on Trump vs. other Republicans, according to those involved.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“She drives a hard bargain,” said a person involved with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “People’s impression of Dick Cheney — that he is a control freak — Liz Cheney has got some of that.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Back at the Old West Museum in Cheyenne, Cheney said issues central to Wyoming “matter a huge amount” in her reelection — but nothing will be more important than investigating Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I have huge respect for the voters of Wyoming,” Cheney said, “so I think that I owe them the truth, and I owe them honesty about how important this is.”</p>"

She teased the investigation’s biggest findings and sharply criticized her fellow Republicans for the roles that they played — including enabling and continuing to support Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“There will come a point when Donald Trump is gone,” Cheney said, “but your dishonor will remain.”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These hearings, which <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/06/january-6-committee-hearing-schedule-how-to-watch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10' target='_blank'>continue Monday</a>, could mark the pinnacle of Cheney’s political career or the end of it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The former  rising star of the GOP has already been alienated by party leaders, abandoned by longtime supporters and  consistently attacked by Trump and his allies, who are backing a primary challenger Cheney will face in August. While most of the nine other <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/01/what-happened-10-house-republicans-who-voted-impeach-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11' target='_blank'>Republicans who voted to impeach Trump</a> after Jan. 6 have either decided not to run for reelection or mostly avoided discussing the former president, Cheney has made her role as the vice chair of the select committee investigating the insurrection central to her pitch to voters. She is trying to convince them she’s on the right side of history — and that her Trump-free approach to conservatism is the right one.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“These issues around what happened on January 6th and around Donald Trump and the danger that he poses, those matter to every American,” Cheney told supporters at a campaign event in Cheyenne, Wyo., on Saturday. “And I just feel very strongly about my responsibility.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In more than 20 conversations with lawmakers, political operatives, foes and friends of the Wyoming Republican, they uniformly describe her as obstinately and surgically focused on extinguishing Trump from the modern conservative movement that he has largely redefined in recent years, with little introspection regarding the forces bigger than Trump that facilitated her ousting from the Wyoming Republican Party  earlier this year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney has said the deadly assault of the U.S. Capitol crossed the party line for her and that she has a nonpartisan duty to set the record straight for the people who were “betrayed and lied to” by Trump. Cheney participated in several private meetings with GOP leaders in the days leading up to the attack and was in the House as insurgents tried breaking down the doors, helping other lawmakers put on gas masks because tear gar has been deployed nearby.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Democrats run the select committee, but they deferred to Cheney — the daughter of a former Republican vice president they still revile — at the opening hearing to methodically lay out the case against Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“She’s had a huge head start on the rest of the committee in understanding these events, because she knows the players and understands the internal political culture of the GOP — this is very familiar terrain for her,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s Republican colleagues have struggled to understand her motives, especially given the political price she is paying in Wyoming, where Trump celebrated his largest margins of victory. Some wonder whether she is angling to run for a higher office.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has told others that he understands Cheney’s position, but “it’s the only thing she cares about,” according to one adviser. “That doesn’t help anyone.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Cheney after her impeachment vote that he would try to protect her if she would drop the Trump<b> </b>attacks, but she declined, people familiar with the matter said. He has privately described her as “obsessed” with Trump and with destroying his political power, they said. Cheney has repeatedly criticized <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/27/mccarthy-trump-audio-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>McCarthy for going to Mar-a-Lago</a> to see Trump soon after the attack, helping the president’s public redemption.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney explained her motives in personal terms at the Saturday campaign event, pointing to Jan. 6 as the moment she realized the peaceful transfer of power was no longer a guarantee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I looked at my boys in the weeks after January 6th; it became very clear that we might suddenly have to question that,” Cheney said.<b> </b>“And I am absolutely committed to do everything I can do, everything that I am required and obligated to do to make sure that we aren’t the last generation in America that can count on a peaceful transition of power. It is hugely important.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Days before the opening hearing, Cheney stood in Cheyenne’s Old West Museum, surrounded by 19th-century horse carriages, and told a small crowd of supporters and warned that Trump “can’t be anywhere close to that power again.” The crowd of about 70 supporters included mostly traditional Republicans, including a few who supported her father’s first campaign more than 40 years ago, as well as some independent-leaning voters.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“What we do in Wyoming is going to matter so much,” she said. “I cannot overstate how much what we do is going to matter, because it’s going to matter from the perspective of our democracy as a whole. It’s going to matter. People are going to watch Wyoming.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Wyoming’s Aug. 16 primary, Cheney faces <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-cheney-hageman-primary/2021/09/08/8723142e-069c-11ec-8c3f-3526f81b233b_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>Harriet Hageman</a>, an attorney and former Republican National Committee member whose campaign is guided by Trump advisers. The former president attended a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/29/trump-wyoming-cheney/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>large rally for Hageman in late May</a> and has claimed that “the people of Wyoming  cannot stand” Cheney.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney advisers describe the race as a difficult one, and Trump has claimed the congresswoman is lagging in the polls. Cheney has held back her vast campaign war chest but last week began what is expected to be a massive TV ad campaign that makes only indirect reference to “standing up to bullies.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>She has not been able to hold large, publicized campaign events, partly for security concerns, and is instead gathering dozens of supporters at a time and then using her digital media team to blast video snippets of the event out to supporters around the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney, 56, has long had a complicated relationship with Wyoming. She attended middle school in the state but mostly grew up in the Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia. Her father, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/january-6-cheney/2022/01/06/72665baa-6f1e-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_41' target='_blank'>Dick Cheney</a>, went from junior White House aide to the youngest presidential chief of staff ever, for Gerald Ford, before returning to Wyoming and winning the state’s sole House seat in 1978.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Liz Cheney’s political viewpoint was formed in her<b> </b>father’s orbit of conservative hawks, particularly once he became secretary of defense in 1989 and then George W. Bush’s vice president. She worked as a State Department deputy assistant secretary focused on Middle East affairs, at a time when wars were launched in Afghanistan and Iraq. She embraced the belief popular among many neoconservatives that all people yearned for democratic governance freed from their autocratic regimes, justifying U.S. military action in many parts of the world and leading Trump to derisively label her a “war monger.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the Obama administration years, Cheney began to carve her own identity, particularly as an acid-tongued partisan commentator on Fox News who belittled the White House. In 2013, she tried to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/11/23/five-realities-of-liz-cheney-vs-mike-enzi/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45' target='_blank'>challenge Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.)</a> but withdrew from the race amid an angry backlash. She then ran for her father’s former House seat in 2016 and won, saying her star power would help the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tim Stubson, a former state representative who lost to Cheney in 2016 but now supports her, said he recalls Cheney saying: “I have a national voice. I have a national presence. I can use that for the benefit of the state of Wyoming.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“That was her pitch,” Stubson said. “And that’s exactly what she did.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Cheney was first running for office, Trump became the party’s presidential nominee.  Stubson remembers her carefully embracing most of Trump’s conservative policies but not his outrageous behavior — later<b> </b>earning her praise from Trump’s family members and senior advisers at a fundraiser in the Wyoming resort town of Jackson in 2019.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump won the state by 46 percentage points in 2016 — slightly better than Mitt Romney did in 2012 — and then by 43 percentage points in 2020.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over that time, Wyoming’s Republican Party has been slowly taken over by conservatives who identify more as Trump supporters than Republicans. The state party is now led by Frank Eathorne, a member of the Oath Keepers who stood on the Capitol’s West Front during the insurrection, walkie-talkie in hand. Cheney has heavily focused on investigating his role, advisers say.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This [takeover] was planned over several years, very organized and very dedicated,” said Joe<b> </b>McGinley, a former Natrona County Republican Party chairman who runs a medical practice in Casper, Wyo. “And they had a long-term goal to take first, the county parties, then the state party, then the legislature, and then all of the other elected positions.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Earlier this month, a group of breakaway Republicans held a candidate forum that included loud heckling of an incumbent state representative wearing a mask — his immuno-suppressing medications make him susceptible to severe outcomes if he develops covid — and even more jeering when he said the state government should accept federal funding, the largest source of state revenue. A long-shot candidate for governor parked his campaign truck, with the motto SOVEREIGN WYOMING painted across the front, outside the event.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>With so many voters tilting in this direction, McGinley believes Cheney’s best hope is to attract a pool of new voters for the primary — soft Republicans who do not normally participate in primaries, as well as some crossover votes from independents and Democrats who<b> </b>can register as Republicans up until the day of the Aug. 16 primary. That, however, could require a major shift in Cheney’s current message. Many of those soft Republican voters, according to McGinley, need to be drawn out on local issues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This is not about President Trump,” McGinley said. “This is about Wyoming. This is about Wyoming needs. This is about Wyoming jobs. Wyoming is struggling under the Biden administration with oil and gas under attack and coal under attack.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some in Wyoming say Cheney hasn’t been as visible as she was in the past, and even advisers and allies wish she was campaigning more, although others note there are concerns about her safety and the reaction of some voters in parts of Wyoming.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s work on the committee has helped her develop a national following and<b> </b>raise a record $10 million for this election so far, with almost $7 million in the bank, a figure that has probably grown over the past two months.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney raised more than $7.2 million last year, an astonishing amount for a state with fewer than 600,000 residents, according to Open Secrets, an independent political funding analyst. A little more than $200,000 came from Wyoming donors, <a href='https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/03/donors-from-outside-of-wyoming-make-up-the-majority-of-rep-liz-cheneys-record-breaking-fundraising-during-the-2022-election-cycle/' target='_blank'>according to the analysis </a> — a statistic her opponent has loudly advertised.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Bobbie Kilberg, a prominent Virginia donor, held a fundraiser for Cheney in a hotel ballroom earlier this year. It was moved from Kilberg’s home because so many people wanted to attend<b> </b>after the Republican Party censured Cheney and announced it would not support her reelection, she said, and 212 people raised $532,000. The crowd included Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Joe McCain, the brother of the late senator John McCain of Arizona.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“There are a lot of Republicans, quiet Republicans who don’t like confrontation, who have had it,” Kilberg said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the event, she said, Cheney offered a fiery denunciation of Trump and his behavior.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“She talked at the fundraiser about respect for the constitution, the rule of law. She said that Donald Trump had not adhered to any of that — his behavior was inexcusable — people had to stand up, and people had to be accountable,” Kilberg said. “She did not shy away in any manner shape or form in her feelings or beliefs that Donald Trump had not respected the rule of law.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A person involved with the Hageman campaign said Cheney could triumph if Democrats decide to cross over in large droves. Still, Cheney faces a problem of basic math. In the last midterm elections, about 115,000 people voted in the GOP primary, while 17,000 voted in the Democratic primary.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If it’s 20 percent, we’re okay; if it’s 30 percent, it gets closer,” the person added, trying to predict how many Democrats will ultimately cross over. For their part, Cheney’s team has not tried to go after crossover voters, according to people familiar with their strategy.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the crowd at Cheney’s Saturday campaign event was Harmon Davis, 75, a retired pulmonologist who didn’t support her in 2016 because he considered her “a carpet bagger” who wasn’t familiar with the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Davis described when he had a change of heart: “When she started to behave like a thinking, courageous leader, and was able to not have to swallow the party politic and was able to speak her mind about things, and to stand up.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Cheney seems to have lost many more supporters, including Doug Cooper, a Wyoming rancher who volunteered for her original campaign, held a dinner for her team at his house and had her cellphone number. He now plans to vote for Hageman.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Until Jan. 6, I was pleased with what she was doing, but she has put all her political assets against Trump. It’s a bad deal,” Cooper said. “I feel that she’s really a traitor to us. … I went from an ardent supporter to as strong an opponent as you can find.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cooper said Trump was right to raise questions about the validity of the 2020 election results and said Democrats deserve some of the blame for the Jan. 6 attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney’s two mortal sins, he said, were voting to impeach Trump and then continuing to criticize him. Cooper said he had tried to email emailed Cheney directly about his concerns but didn’t hear back, and had repeatedly talked to her staff repeatedly about his concerns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Trump is wildly popular in Wyoming,” he said. “She’s alienated herself from a large portion of the Republican Party. Liz has got a problem.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Despite Cheney’s continued conservative convictions — just look at her voting record — she has become somewhat of a hero to liberals who have contributed to her campaign or commended her courage for joining the Jan. 6 committee.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>She has received mostly rave reviews from her Democratic colleagues, who describe her as one of the most aggressive members. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who invited Cheney to be on the committee and appointed her as the vice chairwoman, described the Republican’s leadership as “excellent.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) called her “very smart, very hard-working, thoughtful.” Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.) said there are “few people in Congress I can think of who I enjoy working with more than Liz.”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That doesn’t mean that her new Democratic friends have deluded themselves into believing that Cheney’s now a Democrat. She’s been less “liberated,” according to a person involved with the investigation, and more constrained by her belief system than the other Republican on the committee, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who is retiring from Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It’s been great working with her, but we don’t agree on many, many other issues, as I’m sure you know,” Lofgren said. “She’s a conservative, and I’m not.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cheney did not want the committee to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/05/20/ginni-thomas-arizona-election-emails/?itid=lk_inline_manual_80' target='_blank'>investigate Ginni Thomas</a>, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, according to people involved with the investigation. Cheney did not think it was fair to target the justice without evidence that he was involved, according to those involved, but some Democrats instead saw this as an effort to protect her hardcore Republican credentials. Cheney has also clashed with Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) over how much to focus on Trump vs. other Republicans, according to those involved.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“She drives a hard bargain,” said a person involved with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “People’s impression of Dick Cheney — that he is a control freak — Liz Cheney has got some of that.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Back at the Old West Museum in Cheyenne, Cheney said issues central to Wyoming “matter a huge amount” in her reelection — but nothing will be more important than investigating Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I have huge respect for the voters of Wyoming,” Cheney said, “so I think that I owe them the truth, and I owe them honesty about how important this is.”</p>"

Separating Trump out of the events of that day means focusing extremely narrowly on the initial acts of violence and ignoring 1) why the rioters were at the Capitol and 2) why they were so angry.

Fifty years ago, most Americans regularly watched one of the big three broadcast networks.

The thematic through-line was tight and focused.

Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s testimony in July 2019 also drew nearly 13 million viewers, which was shy of the 19.5 million TV viewers who watched former FBI director James B.

However, the billionaire Elon Musk, who is in the process of acquiring Twitter, has said he would reinstate Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some users Friday argued that Truth Social, which has promoted itself as a free-speech sanctuary to rival what they call Twitter’s censorious “cancel culture,” had worked to squash discussion of the hearing outright.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Travis Allen, an information security analyst in Kentucky, said his Truth Social account was suspended minutes after he replied to Trump’s account there Thursday night with a reference to the Jan. 6 hearing.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Allen, who said he is not a Trump fan, said he couldn’t remember specifically what he wrote but that he didn’t think it violated the site’s rules.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>I didn’t “think the post was even notable,” he told The Washington Post on Friday. “It is the height of hypocrisy for Truth Social to claim to support ‘free speech’ and then ban users for talking about” the hearings.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Representatives for Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The site on Friday did show some posts critical of Trump, though many others panned the congressional investigation as a “hoax.” In February, the site had <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/22/trump-truth-social-disaster/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/22/trump-truth-social-disaster/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45'>banned</a> an account poking fun at former congressman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who resigned from Congress to become chief of the Trump company, with a <a href='https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001849635/000119312522161830/d265650ds1.htm#rom265650_12' target='_blank'>salary</a> of $750,000 a year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Before the hearing, some pro-Trump influencers had urged their online followers to ignore it. Conservative radio host Dan Bongino <a href='https://truthsocial.com/@dbongino/posts/108450138769802757' target='_blank'>posted</a> to his Truth Social account a few minutes before the hearing started, “Don’t miss the hockey game tonight, it’s must-see TV!” That online attitude matched their cable counterparts on Fox News, which showed little of the hearing and labeled it an “ANTI-TRUMP SHOW TRIAL” and “SHAM.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After the hearing, Trump allies sought to discount the findings — based on 1,000 interviews, 140,000 documents and hours of visual evidence — as biased or flawed. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/09/key-jan-6-figure-tries-trump-defense-i-just-riled-everyone-up-brought-them-there/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48' target='_blank'>Ali Alexander</a>, a conservative activist who’d organized a “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6 and testified to the committee in December, <a href='https://truthsocial.com/@ali/posts/108450593485494373' target='_blank'>said</a> on Truth Social that the committee had used “edited videos” and “faked audio” without giving any evidence to back those claims up. “Have you ever seen a video with more fake edits and SPLICES?” he wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The <a href='https://twitter.com/January6thCmte/status/1535082372030414861' target='_blank'>video</a> featured long strings of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/06/10/jan6-new-video/?itid=lk_inline_manual_49' target='_blank'>previously unseen footage</a> from police body cameras and Capitol surveillance cameras that revealed brawls in grisly detail. “We can’t hold this.

In <a href='https://twitter.com/drewharwell/status/1349436733889404928' target='_blank'>one clip</a>, a man in a crowd encircling officers steps from the Capitol screams, “We were invited by the president of the United States.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"

He took an unusually combative tone against corporations — especially against oil and shipping companies — in an attempt to paint a portrait of corporate greed that was ultimately harming consumers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We’re going to make sure that everybody knows Exxon’s profits,” Biden said, noting that the massive oil company “made more money than God this year.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He charged that oil companies are not taking full advantage of the leases they have on federal land. “They have 9,000 permits to drill. They’re not drilling. Why aren’t they drilling?” Biden asked. “Because they make more money not producing more oil. The price goes up, number one, and number two, the reason they’re not drilling is they’re buying back their own stock — which should be taxed, quite frankly — buying back their own stock and making no new investments.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Oil companies have strongly denied that their actions are artificially driving up costs for Americans, saying prices at the pump are driven by sweeping global forces like the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Washington this week, senior White House aides had sat down with chief executives of Exxon and Chevron, the latest in a regular series of meetings in recent months, according to a White House official. This week’s meetings were first reported by CNBC.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden also criticized shipping companies, suggesting that a virtual oligopoly in the industry had driven up prices for consumers. Nine major ocean shipping companies — dividing themselves into three consortia — have contributed to soaring costs of consumers, he said, calling on Congress to crack down on the foreign-owned shipping companies that Biden said brought in $190 billion in profits last year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Every once in a while, something you learn makes you viscerally angry — like, if you had the person in front of you, you’d want to pop them,” Biden said. “No, I really mean it.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden’s tone reflected in part a growing frustration within the White House that the administration has been able to do little to slow the rise in the cost of gas, food and other goods, a trend that risks eclipsing the president’s message and badly hurting his party in the November congressional elections.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Behind the scenes, several prominent Democrats have been pushing to make attacks on the greed of oil and gas companies a centerpiece of the party’s message, in the hopes of making Democrats the party of fighting inflation by the midterms. They argue that the issue of gas prices needs to be reframed as a choice between Democratic support for proactive measures — like suspending the gas tax or prodding oil companies to drill on existing leases — and Republican opposition to taking action.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who runs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, circulated a white paper to her colleagues in the spring titled “Big Oil Price-Gouging Americans at the Pump,” with statistics showing the dramatic increase in company profits between the first quarters of 2019 and 2022.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Oil and gas companies are padding their profits, and hardworking Americans are paying the price,” the document said. “Senate Democrats are committed to stopping oil companies from excessively increasing gas prices. Senate Republicans are committed to blocking legislation that would hold oil and gas companies accountable.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden’s event Friday came as new figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that inflation reached 8.6 percent last month compared with a year earlier, contributing to the fastest hike in prices in the energy, housing and food sectors in four decades.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The rapid run-up in gas prices has become one of the most visceral ways people feel inflation in their daily lives and is emerging as a dominant policy and political problem for the Biden White House. As of Friday morning, the national average for a gallon of gas was $4.99, according to AAA.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a written statement earlier Friday, the president acknowledged that inflation was not “coming down as shapely and as quickly as we must see.” As he has many times before, Biden named Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine as the prime trigger of rising prices, although inflation had started to dog the White House before the February incursion by Russia.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Later, Biden name-checked Putin three times during his speech at the Port of Los Angeles, as he highlighted his administration’s work to streamline supply chains and boasted of the improvements to American ports that is included in the bipartisan infrastructure law enacted last November.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I’m doing everything in my power to blunt Putin’s price hike and bring down the cost of gas and food,” Biden said, standing on the deck of the USS Iowa, a battleship that has been transformed into a museum.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden has said combating inflation is his chief domestic priority this year. But his additional focus on migration, on the final day of the Ninth Summit of the Americas, also highlighted the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce the number of migrants arriving at the southern border.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Crucially, the administration has grappled with how and when to end a Trump-era policy that has allowed the United States to turn numerous would-be migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border under health restrictions related to the pandemic.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That policy, known as Title 42, remained in place after a federal judge in a ruling last month blocked the Biden administration from lifting it. The administration had planned to rescind the controversial policy on May 23, triggering protests from Republicans and some Democratic lawmakers that the nation could not handle the increase in asylum seekers that would materialize once Title 42 was removed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Friday, Biden sought a more welcoming tone, noting that a joint declaration signed by various nations at the Americas summit showed that “when migrants arrive on their doorstep, they can provide a place to stay, make sure migrants can see a doctor, they can find a place to work.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the same time, Biden underscored his efforts to go after smugglers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you,” Biden said. “We are coming after you.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>Kim reported from Washington.

And it hasn’t quite been able to reassemble.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Whether the major social networks allow Trump to return could have a profound effect on his ability to reorganize for a 2024 run, Donovan added.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>While Facebook and YouTube suspended him indefinitely, leaving open the possibility that he could be back, Twitter issued a permanent ban, and Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy said Friday that the company stands by that.

Let them say the truth. I told them that: ‘Just say the truth.’ ”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But when the public got its first glimpse on Thursday night of what Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had to say,<b> </b>the former president appeared less generous — issuing a statement that pushed back on her testimony.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “She had long since checked out.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump was reacting to a short clip of Ivanka Trump that was played during Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) opening statement, in which the former president’s daughter said she accepted Attorney General William P. Barr’s conclusion that there was no widespread fraud affecting the outcome — even as her father was continuing in public to falsely insist it had been stolen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It affected my perspective,” Ivanka Trump said in the clip. “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The discord marks a new twist on a close father-daughter relationship that has spanned family, business and politics, exposing a rift that has opened since the 2020 election, according to other Trump advisers. Before Jan. 6, Ivanka Trump broke with her father and siblings in avoiding baseless fraud allegations and attempts to overturn the election results. On <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/what-happened-trump-jan-6-insurrection/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12' target='_blank'>the day of the Capitol riot</a>, she repeatedly tried to convince the president to make a statement or video calling for his supporters to stop the attack, The Post has reported.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That tension could mount as the committee holds more<b> </b>hearings this month. Ivanka Trump’s descriptions of her efforts to press her father into action on Jan. 6 have made her a key witness for investigators, people familiar with her testimony said. The committee interviewed both Ivanka Trump and Kushner for hours and has also indicated that it will release transcripts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“You’re probably going to get a heavy dose of Jared and Ivanka going forward,” said a lawyer representing other witnesses who spoke on the condition of anonymity because those discussions are confidential.

The clip made for one of the most dramatic moments in the first hearing, which drew a television audience of almost <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/06/10/nearly-19-million-watched-first-jan-6-hearing-prime-time/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>19 million Americans</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I don’t know if anybody walked in thinking they’re going to have videos shown on prime time,” said a former Trump White House adviser, who like others interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay private discussions.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Representatives for Ivanka Trump, Kushner and Donald Trump did not respond to requests for comment. But another former Trump adviser disputed that Trump was angry with his daughter over the testimony.

The couple have<a href='https://therealdeal.com/miami/2021/07/06/jared-and-ivanka-paid-24m-for-this-waterfront-indian-creek-estate-sources/' target='_blank'> reportedly bought an estate</a> on an exclusive Miami-Dade island.<b> </b>One adviser who is regularly around the president said: “I’ve seen Jared one time.” But the former president still regularly talks to Ivanka Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>His post on Friday also appeared to defend his daughter’s testimony as “only trying to be respectful to Bill Barr” — whom Trump had much harsher words for.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some other conservatives criticized the use of the video as a cheap shot. “The Ivanka Trump clip has gotten a lot of attention, but its inclusion was entirely gratuitous and clearly meant simply to embarrass her,” National Review’s editor in chief, Rich Lowry, <a href='https://twitter.com/RichLowry/status/1535252508288991233?s=20&amp;t=qwZOR1MgS2gaTMRwdvGT8w' target='_blank'>said on Twitter</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In deciding to cooperate with the committee, Ivanka Trump and Kushner may have considered the investigators’ aggressive use of criminal contempt referrals for witnesses refusing to appear.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“They didn’t want to be in the same category as Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro,” the lawyer representing other witnesses said, referring to the former Trump advisers who’ve been indicted after defying the committee’s subpoenas.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Ivanka Trump has long participated in her father’s business ventures, including a New York condo project that recently drew prosecutors’ <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-ivanka-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-avoided-a-criminal-indictment' target='_blank'>scrutiny but no charges</a>, and the Washington hotel at the center of multiple<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/saudi-funded-lobbyist-paid-for-500-rooms-at-trumps-hotel-after-2016-election/2018/12/05/29603a64-f417-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'> conflict-of-interest</a> <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2017/03/08/top-official-overseeing-trumps-d-c-hotel-is-out-at-gsa-as-democrats-call-for-investigation-of-lease/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'>investigations</a> and <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/03/trump-hotel-nonprofit-settlement/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'>lawsuits</a> during his presidency. She also branched out to launch <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/ivanka-trump-overseas/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'>her own clothing line</a>, and Kushner brought his own wealth, media ventures and family real estate empire.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As the couple sidestepped anti-nepotism rules to take White House jobs, Ivanka Trump initially presented herself as a moderating force. A onetime Democrat who supported gay rights and abortion rights, she later announced that she became a “<a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/politics/ivanka-trump-republican.html' target='_blank'>Trump Republican</a>” and opposed abortion, prompting <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/ivanka-trump-political-future-459758' target='_blank'>speculation</a> about her own political ambitions. The couple’s special treatment as the only advisers who could stake out their own positions and could not be fired was frequently a sore point for other staffers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“They could float in and out when they wanted to, while the rest of everybody else didn’t have that luxury,” the former White House official said. “They sold the whole thing at the beginning as being the people who could moderate him.

Trump sought to throw out the votes of millions of American and substitute his will for the will of the voters in claiming repeatedly without evidence that fraud changed the outcome, they said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Howell noted that lawmakers said planning leading up to Jan. 6 began weeks earlier. Cheney said one “pivotal moment” came on Dec. 19, 2020, after a White House meeting among Trump and adviser Michael Flynn, attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and others, when Trump tweeted, referring to Jan. 6, “Be there, will be Wild!”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House’s two-hour presentation Thursday and the promise of further televised hearings this month has alarmed attorneys for some individual criminal defendants charged in the rioting.

Kelly, a 2017 Trump appointee who is presiding over the case of defendants including former longtime Proud Boys chairman Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, called such a claim “<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/09/proud-boys-tarrio-seditious-conspiracy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_22' target='_blank'>unwarranted</a>,” but said he is or would consider motions to move or delay an Aug. 8 trial.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Separately Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas F.

Nichols’s defense did not say what it would like to release. All of the video exhibits he has entered, including hours of footage from the riot, is already in the public record.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Hogan, a 1982 Ronald Reagan appointee, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1997/08/10/immunity-and-iran-contra/729d0ea9-0023-41ce-939b-c0520a1ebf08/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29'>noted that similar conflicts arose</a> during the Watergate and Iran-contra investigations. He noted that a judge eventually overturned the criminal convictions of a central figure in the latter arms-for-hostages scandal, retired Marine Lt. Col.

Tom Rice seemed to be in the deepest political peril.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Myrtle Beach Republican lawyer with a country club demeanor and a southern drawl sailed into four terms with a conservative voting record, even winning by 24 points in 2020. But his impeachment vote was roundly jeered in his ruby-red district on the South Carolina coast. His Facebook was inundated with thousands of vitriolic messages and still is. Friendships frayed, he said. Multiple challengers jumped in the race against him, fueled by Trump’s call for his ouster. His doom was widely predicted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Rice has a fighting chance to keep his seat, or at least make it to a runoff against a Trump-backed challenger, according to South Carolina political observers and people who have watched the race closely.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As he traverses country music festivals and barbecues in the final days of the heated Republican primary here, the 64-year-old lawyer and country club Republican is making a different bet: That being against Trump in the future is the way to go, even in a district Trump won by almost 20 points in the 2020 election and in a state where his approval is still sky high among Republicans, according to public polls.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a recent interview, he excoriated the former president and said he was a “diminished” figure who lost the election and did not need to lead the Republican Party, ticking off a series of others who could instead.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I absolutely believe that we’ve got to get back to our principles of defending the Constitution — not just loyalty to one very divisive man, because that is a horribly destructive path for the Republican Party to head down,” he said. “It’s one of the reasons I want to fight as hard as I’m fighting, to prove that we’re not just about loyalty to a would-be tyrant.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/01/what-happened-10-house-republicans-who-voted-impeach-trump/?itid=ap_amberphillips&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_13' target='_blank'> 10 House Republicans who voted for impeachment</a> — who keep in touch via group text, according to Rice — have faced wildly different outcomes since Trump’s wrath made them pariahs in their own party. Some are not running for reelection after facing difficult GOP primaries. Several others are fighting uphill battles. Two of them, Reps. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) and Liz Cheney (Wyo.), have turned into constant Trump critics, while others, such as Rep. Jamie Herrera Butler (Wash.) have tried to moderate their criticisms as they attempt to stay in office against primary challengers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The group has dined with former American Enterprise Institute president Arthur Brooks twice, Rice said, and “we comment on the news of the day, we encourage each other, we talk. … We’ve all become friends.” He declined to get into detail about the precise conversations but said the group had talked about Trump’s attacks on them and how to overcome them.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some declined interviews because they said they didn’t want to make their campaigns about being against Trump, who has endorsed a challenger in each of their races. An aide to one said, “There is no benefit whatsoever to talking about Trump.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) decided not to run for reelection last year, citing the “toxic dynamics” that exist within the GOP toward those who do not toe the party line.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Gonzalez said he was “not really thinking” about elections when asked about the nine other pro-impeachment Republicans who are facing tough primaries. But he did acknowledge that their vote has bonded the group.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It’s been fun to get to know people that otherwise I didn’t know,” he said. “To become close and tightknit with all of them has been really rewarding and something that I frankly treasure.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a recent interview, Trump said he took particular pride in his efforts to beat the 10 members, and advisers said it was his highest priority in 2022. “You had people drop out of races that they had no intention of dropping out of, and the other ones are losing, like Rice in South Carolina,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Taylor Budowich, a Trump spokesman, said in a statement that the former president “pays careful attention to every race and endorses candidates who will be champions for his America First agenda, especially in races where weak, dishonest RINOs have abandoned their constituents and instead embraced the Woke Mob.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There has been no reliable public polling of the race, but Rice allies believe the Trump-backed challenger, Russell Fry, is their strongest opponent and hope to keep him under 50 percent to force a runoff. A <a href='https://www.winthrop.edu/winthroppoll/current-findings.aspx' target='_blank'>Winthrop University poll</a> earlier this year showed Trump has an 89 percent approval rating among Republicans in the state, higher than any other GOP political figure.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One reason Trump’s endorsement has not necessarily halted Rice, according to some South Carolina political observers, is that he only held one rally in the state, which attracted a few thousand people, and one tele-rally, but has not spent any money in the state.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump is also campaigning against Rep. Nancy Mace, another South Carolina Republican he has endorsed against — even though she did not vote for impeachment. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and former U.N. ambassador under Trump, has campaigned for Mace, angering Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If the Trump organization was willing to spend as much money as they are political capital, they may have won a lot more races,” said Tim Pearson, a longtime South Carolina operative who was a top Haley adviser.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Rice’s deeply religious district, pro-Trump flags and signs dot Highway 501, and evangelical voters helped propel Trump to a wide victory. It has seen a population boom in recent years fueled by a promise of lower property taxes and proximity to the beach. Many of the retirees have come from the north, residents say, with subdivisions sprouting all over rural towns like Aynor and Conway.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The local Republican Party has changed, according to Rice and South Carolina political consultants. Some leaders in the local party have agreed with Trump’s false claims the election was stolen, and the party has deliberately left Rice out of at least one prominent event. In Horry County, the local Republican Party’s website touts a recent speech from former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and an AR-15 that Flynn signed for a raffle.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The local county party was having meetings where some were telling people not to get vaccinated,” Rice said, adding that he opposed that advice.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rice had always been popular — never facing much of a Republican challenge, campaigning for Trump and touting his conservative record — until now. He has lived in South Carolina his whole life and runs a law firm that has his name attached.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He vigorously campaigned for Trump throughout the 2020 presidential election season and defended some of Trump’s most controversial moves in office. He rarely voted against the Republican Party and did not vote to certify the election, even after the Capitol was ransacked — a vote he says he now regrets.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a recent interview, Rice said he didn’t regret supporting Trump either time, called his presidency “consequential” and said the country would be better off had Trump won over Joe Biden.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I thought he hit the wrong button,” Walter Whetsell, Rice’s campaign consultant, said of his impeachment vote. Rice said many people called him to make sure he’d voted correctly that day on the floor, but he voted and immediately left Washington, expecting some opprobrium.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rice said the vote was obvious to him after he studied what Trump did that day — attacking and not calling former vice president Mike Pence, not calling other officials or not doing anything to show remorse.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“When you throw a temper tantrum after the election that culminates with a lie and the sacking of the Capitol of the United States, and you sit there and watch the Capitol get ransacked and the Capitol Police get beaten for three hours, and you don’t lift a finger to stop it, it’s indefensible,” he said. “To sic that crowd on Mike Pence and his wife and his daughter is just an unhinged direct attack on our Constitution.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rice said the impeachment vote made his race undoubtedly much harder, but that he would not change it. In the beginning, Rice said he was frequently confronted in the district for his vote, but that he also received considerable support after explaining it at town halls. The comments on his social media pages suggest that, at least among Republican activists, he remains deeply unpopular. Hundreds still attack him weekly for his vote, and local activists have rallied support against him.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Since then, Rice said, more “random people” send him contributions, but support from the official GOP has all but dried up — and others have come into the district to campaign against him. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), he said, has not helped him even though he is an incumbent.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“They are very afraid of and deferential to the president. They feel like if they alienate him, then their prospects are diminished,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rice said he has defended his impeachment decision repeatedly to his constituents, but that most now ask him about inflation, gas prices, President Biden or Afghanistan. While the impeachment vote once came up repeatedly, he says “now maybe I get asked about it once at every event.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a recent debate, Fry and the other challengers repeatedly eviscerated Rice for his impeachment vote, leaving him alone on the stage to defend himself.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rice said his main opponent, Fry, had made his entire campaign about a “litmus test” on Trump and impeachment while he wanted to talk about projects he’d gotten funded in his district and other national issues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“He doesn’t know who Russell Fry is,” Rice said of Trump. “It’s just desperate revenge and spite.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“When’s the last time you had a president, any president in your lifetime, come and play in a primary election for revenge? I can’t name a single time in my life,” he continued. “He’s absolutely been diminished. There is no doubt he has. There is no path for him to be president again in terms of winning an election. He wants attention, and he’s afraid he’s going to lose it.”</p>"

But her popularity in Alaska <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/16/palin-campaign-alaska/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5'>has faded</a> since her time as governor, and a new ranked-choice voting system — designed to elect candidates with broad support — could complicate her bid.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Alaska Republican Party, meanwhile, has endorsed Nick Begich III, a former campaign co-chair for Young from a family well-known in state Democratic politics.

She went on to champion the conservative tea party movement and secure a lucrative book deal and appearances on <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/05/20/masked-singer-finale-kandi-burruss/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_23'>reality TV</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think maybe she left us behind somewhere on the way to fame,” one conservative local official, Jesse Sumner, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/16/palin-campaign-alaska/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25'>told The Washington Post</a> this spring.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Palin declared her candidacy for Alaska’s House seat just before the filing deadline, focusing on concerns about inflation and the need for “energy security” in a statement posted to social media. “As I’ve watched the far left destroy the country,” she wrote, “I knew I had to step up and join the fight.” Trump announced his support days later, noting that Palin endorsed him early on in his presidential bid.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Twitter, Palin has also been touting endorsements from Donald Trump Jr., conservative radio host Dan Bongino, former Texas governor Rick Perry and more. Begich sought to play down the significance of the former president’s decision to wade into the contest.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Alaskans are very independent people, and we will think for ourselves,” Begich said in the interview Friday, when asked about the influence of Trump’s endorsement. He highlighted his endorsements from leaders in Alaska.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Santa Claus is regarded as a real contender for finishing in the top four.

Trump has targeted moderate Republicans around the country for their votes to impeach him or certify his 2020 election loss, and Murkowski voted last year to remove him from office after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump has endorsed an challenger for the Senate, Kelly Tshibaka. But it remains to be seen how much he will influence the race. Murkowski has survived challenges from within her party before: In 2010, she won reelection as a write-in candidate after losing the Republican primary.</p>"

Ron DeSantis, meanwhile, have discussed the margins for his 2022 reelection that would help put him in position to run for president in 2024 — aiming to beat the three percentage point margin that separated Trump and President Biden in the state in 2020.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>With months to go before the midterm elections, the shadow campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination is well underway, with at least 15 potential candidates traveling the country, drawing up plans, huddling with donors or testing out messages at various levels of preparation. The quadrennial circus — described by more than 20 people with direct knowledge who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private machinations — has kicked into gear despite the public hints from Trump that he too plans to join the scrum “a third time.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Interviews with over a dozen GOP operatives indicate he is not clearing the field, and a range of candidates plan to take him on from different angles.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“They’re all going to run against him,” said Tony Fabrizio, Trump’s longtime pollster. “If you have the former vice president running, what does that say for the loyalty argument?”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some candidates and their teams have made clear that they plan to campaign on moving the party beyond Trump, who continues to dominate early polling, while the vast majority are simply plodding forward without addressing the Trump question publicly and in some cases continuing to praise him. They have been encouraged by growing concern among deep-pocketed Republican donors that another Trump run — especially an announcement before the midterms — would help Democrats.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At least six senators have made appearances in Iowa or New Hampshire already, joining former Trump advisers and appointees like Pence, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and former ambassador to the U.N. Nicki Haley. Nine potential candidates, including former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, have spoken at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, laying out their vision for the future of the party, with Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), a prominent Trump critic with a national profile, scheduled to speak there on June 29. Pompeo in particular has been aggressive at working donors and operatives, asking many what he needs to do to win the nomination. Pompeo has told others he would run against Trump, though he has not made a final decision, people who have spoken to him say.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“They are working hard at it, some more than others,” said Ron Kaufman, a Republican National Committee member from Massachusetts, who had a set of potential candidates over to his house in March as part of a fundraiser for the New Hampshire state party. In addition to Cotton, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) spoke at the event.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“There are a lot of good people who are thinking about it and would like to be president,” said Kaufman, who has been involved in presidential campaigns since 1980. “Former presidents who can serve another term always have a special status at least for the first two years.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump and his allies have begun preparing for an onslaught of competition, as several of Trump’s closest advisers continue to urge him not to announce a campaign before the midterm elections, since they fear it would help Democratic efforts to frame Senate and congressional campaigns around the divisive former president.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I would be very surprised if they run,” Trump said in an interview earlier this year. But he has begun asking advisers how he should attack some of his former Cabinet members and allies, as well as candidates he previously endorsed. DeSantis poses particular problems, two advisers said, because he has gained such favor with Trump’s base.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Internal polling by Club for Growth and other private show Trump easily winning primaries at the moment in many early states, though such polls are historically a poor predictor of the outcome two years out.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I’ll be shocked if he doesn’t run. All the polling shows he would be the front-runner by a country mile. The day that Trump makes it clear he’s going to run — it would be a mountain to climb to beat him,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent confidant. “If it’s a policy election, he’s in good shape. It’s his primary to lose.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Many potential candidates disagree, pointing to a long history of early front-runners for presidential nominations falling out of favor. Former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was not a contender in some 1990 polling for the Democratic nomination. In June of 2006, Gallup found that 36 percent of Democratic-leaning voters supported then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) for the 2008 nomination, followed by 16 percent for former vice president Al Gore. The eventual winner of both the nomination and the presidency, Barack Obama, did not yet rate.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The same pattern has haunted Republicans. In June of 2006, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani led the Republican field in Gallup with 29 percent support among Republican-leaning voters. He would finish the primaries two years later without winning a single delegate. Then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who had polled hear the top of the pack in 2015, dropped out two months after declaring his candidacy.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Iowa, which is expected to host the first Republican caucus in 2024, political power brokers like Bob Vander Plaats, the president of the Family Leader, a Christian conservative group, has been telling people that even if Trump runs there is a good chance of a contested campaign.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If you come at Trump from the left — say a Mitt Romney approach — I don’t think that would ever work,” he said. “If you came at Trump from the right — more like a Pence or a Pompeo or a Ted Cruz or a DeSantis — then I think people would be willing to listen.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After visits by Pence and Pompeo in recent months, the Family Leader has invited Fox News Host Tucker Carlson to speak at its annual conference in July.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In addition to the growing candidate competition, Trump is facing declining influence among the Republican high-dollar donor community who supported his 2020 campaign, as many fear the risks of another Trump candidacy, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. In conversations with RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and others, some of the party’s top donors have suggested the party needs to move on, according to the people.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Republicans think he is declining in relevance and they want someone else,” said one adviser close to major Republican donors. “But people feel like they have to appease him. We are in the appeasement phase.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Some activists have complained privately that he won’t talk as much about inflation, gas prices and other topics that they view as the strongest lines of attack against Biden. Christie, who is eyeing a run, said people are increasingly talking about issues other than Trump’s preferred topic: his false claims of a stolen 2020 election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“As I travel around the country campaigning for other Republican candidates, there is more and more doubt and disinterest regarding the president’s claims the 2020 election was stolen. They care about the issues affecting them,” Christie said in an interview.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Pence views South Carolina as key to his campaign, and has repeatedly traveled to meet with donors and operatives in the state. He also has met with some of the party’s richest donors and flew to Israel on megadonor Miriam Adelson’s jet. Allies are eyeing a spring 2023 announcement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“At some point early next year, they’ll get away and try to discern where their calling is, and where they’re being led to serve,” said Marc Short, his longtime chief of staff, referring to Pence and his wife, Karen. “It won’t be based on any other one person.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But some donors and even allies question whether Pence — who refused Trump’s demands to attempt to overturn the 2020 election — can gain traction against his former boss, and he has privately and publicly shown little desire to attack Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>DeSantis has been quietly building his fundraising networks while grabbing national headlines for his challenges to the Biden administration and for his focus on culture war issues. Without mentioning Trump, he has told donors, “No one’s nomination is inevitable,” according to a person to whom his comments have been relayed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Beating Trump’s 2020 margin of three percentage points in Florida has become a key campaign goal, according to three people familiar with the conversations. They said DeSantis’s wife, Casey, a former television host and among a small circle of confidants, wants him to run for president. The couple believes that the governor’s skills are uniquely matched to the current political climate, and are wary of waiting six years, by which time the tides may have shifted. DeSantis has not indicated if he would defer a campaign if Trump runs.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A spokesman for DeSantis’s reelection campaign, David Abrams, said the governor is “focused on winning a resounding reelection this fall in Florida because that’s what’s best for the future of Florida.” He called suggestions of other motives “nonsense.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Behind the scenes, DeSantis and his team think they’ve overtaken Trump with the party’s major donors, according to an ally in touch with the governor. A former aide said DeSantis has spoken about wanting to expand his dominance in that realm, including by getting a contribution from Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor who backed Trump in 2016 and has put nearly $30 million behind a pair of Republican Senate candidates this year. The two have spoken, according to two people familiar with their interactions.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>DeSantis has been picking up support in far-flung places, besting Trump in a recent straw poll at a conservative gathering in Colorado.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think DeSantis is the only one besides Trump who has a chance in hell. And I would bet a lot of money on that,” said Darren Blanton, a Dallas-based venture capitalist who served as an adviser to Trump’s transition. “At first I thought DeSantis had no chance because he seemed more like an introvert and strategist, but not a charismatic celebrity, and I pretty much told him that to his face. But he has really impressed me by how much better he has gotten.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Blanton said potential candidates have to show they can turn blue-collar Democrats into Republicans. “And I just don’t think a pasty, old-school, dignified Republican is ever going to do that again,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Haley and Pompeo are both doing one-on-one calls with major donors, plugging fundraising committees aimed at boosting candidates in the midterms.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Haley in the past month has promoted an upcoming retreat for her group, Stand for America PAC. Among the sums she has brought in for endorsed candidates includes nearly $800,000 for Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and nearly $240,000 for Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate for Senate in Georgia, according to a person familiar with her political operation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>She also went to Mar-a-Lago recently to see Trump for a brief meeting, people familiar with the matter said, and has said she will not run against him.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Pompeo — who prominently campaigned against Trump’s endorsed Pennsylvania Senate candidate, Mehmet Oz, who ended up winning — has used his advocacy for various congressional candidates this cycle to pitch himself as a 2024 contender, telling donors that the “America First” agenda is best embodied by a candidate with a more broadly appealing profile. He has met with dozens of donors and begun hiring a team of advisers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the last year, Pompeo reached out to Charlie Kirk, the leader of the influential conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA and an ally of Donald Trump Jr., according to a person familiar with their communication. While Turning Point USA does not endorse candidates, Kirk also controls an affiliated group, Turning Point Action, as well as the recently launched Turning Point PAC, which already has a multimillion dollar war chest.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I went to an event for Pompeo in L.A., an event in New York and have also met with him,” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor. “But I’ve been invited to 15 or 20 events he’s doing. He is barnstorming the country. He is very active.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A person familiar with Pompeo’s political operation said he’s focused “almost exclusively” on helping candidates in races this November but has been engaged in conversations about the prospect of running for president — a decision he’ll make with his family at a later time.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The political team of Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has been seeking to expand his donor base, reaching out to major contributors far from South Carolina with what one recipient described as “highly sophisticated and personalized communications.” He recently spoke at the Reagan library and has appeared in both New Hampshire and Iowa since 2020.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Sen. Rick Scott, who is running Republican Senate midterm efforts, has been building his own fundraising lists by promoting an extensive set of national policy plans, which have attracted criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. He revised the plan this week, dropping a proposal to require “all Americans” to pay some income tax.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Similarly, Cotton, who has been to Iowa and spoke at the Reagan library, has been revising his slide presentation, which at once point featured five policy areas that explain why he’s electable. “He is diligently putting together a foundation to run,” said Eberhart, the donor who has met with him. “He is very dialed in on New Hampshire.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a former homeland security secretary, has been among the most diligent potential candidates, planning a trip to New Hampshire, appearing repeatedly on Sunday news talk shows and recently founding a nonprofit, America Strong and Free, to pay staff and fund his policy efforts. He said last month at a Wall Street Journal event that the GOP needs to de-link from Trump and “stay away from the culture of personality.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“There are going to be very few people standing on the stage that have the breath of national security experience that he has,” said one Arkansas Republican operative who has tracked Hutchinson’s activities. “He is a party guy, he spoke at the convention in 2016. He is also the first to say it is time to move on.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Hogan and Christie are also aiming to test the party’s appetite for moving on from Trump, as they have both become frequent critics of his behavior.

The Senate recently <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/ukraine-aid-senate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24' target='_blank'>passed </a>a bill that features a combined $20 billion in military aid and is expected to finance the transfer of advanced weapons systems, such as Patriot antiaircraft missiles and long-range artillery. Also included in the bill is more than $8 billion in general economic support for Ukraine, nearly $5 billion in global food aid to address potential food shortages sparked by the collapse of the Ukrainian agricultural economy, and more than $1 billion in combined support for refugees.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden recently confirmed that his administration was sending medium-range advanced rocket systems to Ukraine, responding to a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/05/27/artillery-long-range-ukraine-rocket-system/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_26'>top request from Ukrainian officials</a> who say the weapons are necessary to curb the advance of Russian forces in the east. Biden’s announcement triggered an angry response from Kremlin officials, who said they “believe that the United States is deliberately and diligently ‘pouring fuel on the fire.’”</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But before the invasion, some questioned whether Zelensky was prepared for the Russian attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As top U.S. and European officials raised the alarm in January that Putin could send troops and tanks across the border, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/30/ukraine-zelensky-russia-biden/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31'>the Ukrainian leader had appealed for calm</a> and implored his citizens not to give in to panic. Zelensky had said — repeatedly — that he was not convinced that a Russian assault was imminent.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Take a breath,” he said in a video posted to his official website on Jan. 19. “Calm down.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When acknowledging a potential Russian attack earlier this year, Zelensky attempted to avoid, as he put it, “panic in the markets, panic in the financial sector,” knowing a possible war would be unsettling to the Ukrainian economy.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Friday night, Biden again took aim at Putin, whom he has blamed for some of the historic inflation in the United States. Biden accused the Russian president of “trying to obliterate the [Ukrainian] culture, not just the nation, but the culture,” according to Bloomberg.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Podolyak told <a href='https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/838521.html' target='_blank'>Interfax </a>that the Ukrainian government did recognize the possibility of an invasion.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Ukraine understood the intentions of the Russians, expected one or another aggressive scenario, prepared for it,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He added that Zelensky had “high-quality intelligence” ahead of the invasion, and that the scale of the attack surprised not just Ukraine but the world.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The president also responded carefully to all the words and warnings of our partners. The question was always what will be the scope of the invasion?” Podolyak said. “Undoubtedly, the volume of the invasion, which we saw on Feb. 24, shocked many countries, including our partners.”</p>"

Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) knew he had a problem when Newt Gingrich showed up at the House GOP retreat in Florida in March.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Gingrich led the 1994 midterm blowout that helped Republicans gain 54 seats and their first majority in 40 years, the type of midterm result that today’s GOP lawmakers seemed to think  is possible, given President Biden’s miserable job approval and inflation’s continuing to soar.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Emmer needed to set expectations right. “I’m confident that we’re going to end up in the majority. But what that number is, we’ll let the voters tell us,” he recalled telling colleagues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He was also trying to explain a bit of modern political science, tamping down a building sense of irrational exuberance among some Republicans and utter despair among some Democrats. There are many more less-competitive seats now than there were  in the 1990s, before redistricting turned into a science.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Plus, voters have grown so polarized that straight-party voting has become  the norm, leading to fewer seats that swing back and forth, according to Charlie Cook, an independent election analyst. Republicans gained more than 10 House seats in the 2020 elections even as Joe Biden won the presidential popular vote by more than 7 million. That historic anomaly left Emmer on the precipice of the majority, needing a net gain of five seats, but it also means there are few seats for Republicans to win.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Just as the ‘A’ seat on an airliner is always a window seat, a party cannot lose a seat they don’t have. In modern times, big wave elections have tended to come from a party well behind in seats,” Cook wrote in <a href='https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/717735/even-in-a-great-year-republicans-winnable-seats-are-limited/' target='_blank'>National Journal</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Emmer blanched in November when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), after big GOP gains in Virginia and New Jersey’s off-year elections, predicted that this year’s midterms could be “more competitive” than the 2010 blowout in which Republicans flipped 63 seats.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“He walked it back pretty fast,” Emmer said, declining to say whether he asked McCarthy to dial back his predictions.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Emmer has taken to citing three statistics for his Republican colleagues and donors: A gain of 18 seats  would give the GOP a bigger majority than in Gingrich’s first days as speaker in 1995; a 30-seat gain would be a bigger majority than after the GOP’s historic 2010 gains; and a 35-seat pickup would create their largest majority in more than 90 years.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Down in Florida, Emmer poked fun at Gingrich for his overly hyped predictions. “He can use whatever numbers he wants to use with that big brain,” Emmer recalled telling his colleagues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Aside from his thick head of white hair, Emmer couldn’t be more different from the professorial Gingrich. Emmer, 61, in his fourth term representing suburbs northwest of Minneapolis, presents as a classic Midwestern backslapping politician.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>His hockey gear from a recent charity game is splayed all over his corner office at the NRCC. He wears a St. Cloud State University golf shirt and can rattle off the hockey’s teams recent history in the NCAA hockey tournament.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Emmer, in his second term running the campaign arm, doesn’t have every name of his top candidates memorized — “I forget her name,” he said of one favored candidate, “what’s her name?” — and cannot rattle off every district in contention. He is not a data maven, a contrast to his counterpart, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.), the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/should-house-democrats-write-off-rural-congressional-districts/2017/02/09/9ea98502-eee0-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_23' target='_blank'>once built a database analyzing 350 unique characteristics </a>of House races.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Emmer is conservative but not flamboyant, different from his predecessor, former representative Michelle Bachmann (R), who favored the ideological warfare of cable news. After supporting an early lawsuit contesting the 2020 presidential election, Emmer voted to certify Biden’s victory.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But his demeanor belies a sharp study of history. He understands how today’s political battles mostly take shape close to the middle of the field, between the two parties’ 40-yard lines, maybe even their 45-yard lines.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The big majorities of the past, now the next 10 years, they’re going to be adjusted, probably be smaller,” Emmer said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>While he wants to set expectations properly, Emmer is still trying to build an operation that can maximize every GOP opportunity possible.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The NRCC’s target list starts with 16 districts Donald Trump won in 2020 but are now held by Democrats, some of which are much more GOP-leaning after redistricting. There are 11 more seats that Democrats hold in districts Biden won by fewer than 5 percentage points.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After that, Emmer warns his colleagues, Republicans are stretching deep into Democratic territory: about 17 seats Biden won by a margin between 5 and 10 points, and another 31 he won by more than 10 points.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Those “reach” seats will test just how polarized the electorate is, because if political minds are really  set in stone, it’s very difficult to win seats such as those held by Reps. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), whose district Biden won by 11 percentage points, and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), whose district Biden won by more than 15 points.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Yet Emmer touts them as possible gains, noting that four years ago they were held by longtime GOP incumbents. “These are seats that were held by Republicans until recently. These are seats that both candidates ran as moderate problem solvers who were going to come to Washington, D.C., and actually get something done with Republicans,” he said,  noting that Porter’s staunch liberal voting record is out of step with Orange County.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the most recent House wave election, 2018, Democrats gained more than 40 seats and took the majority as the independent voters in the suburbs recoiled from Donald Trump’s erratic style in the White House.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>According to Cook’s analysis, Democrats won seven seats in districts where Trump two years earlier had won by at least 10 points — five of which Republicans claimed in 2020.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans believe that they will win some of these big Biden-margin seats. According to Emmer, the NRCC has run seven polls of the most competitive districts and found that independent voters and GOP voters have the same priorities: inflation, the economy and crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Democratic voters, he said, have focused on climate change and the  coronavirus pandemic as their top issues.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The voters are not that polarized. In fact, Republicans and independents are almost — well not almost — Republicans and independents, the independents that will determine who controls the House, are perfectly aligned,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Emmer takes a stronger line against the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, than most GOP leaders take, but he believes the ongoing select committee investigation is not moving middle-of-the-road voters who will decide most close races.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I will tell you from a political standpoint, we’ve looked at this across the country. The issues that matter most to the people out there are inflation and the economy,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s clear that Trump remains such a wild card that many Republican candidates  would prefer that the ex-president stay away from their races, particularly those in the suburbs.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Yet Republicans still can’t say that out loud.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“He makes his own decisions. He does his own thing when it comes to different candidates and incumbents,” Emmer said of Trump.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Emmer still remembers the bitter feeling he had at the first GOP caucus meeting after the 2020 elections, when, against the odds, his side gained seats.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If about 35,000 votes had broken  the other way in five races, Emmer would have delivered the majority. He didn’t understand the standing ovation his colleagues gave him, likening it to being happy with just getting to the Super Bowl, like his beloved Minnesota Vikings, who lost the big game four times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Are they all Vikings fans just happy to be in the big game? You lost, you finished second. So the goal here is to finish it,” Emmer said.</p>"

The special election primary will be conducted largely by mail, though there are some in-person voting locations — so results may be slow to come in. Mail ballots must have been postmarked or received Saturday — labeled “Election Day” by the state’s Division of Elections — or earlier. As of Wednesday, more than 117,000 ballots out of more than half a million total were received, according to <a href='https://elections.alaska.gov/doc/info/Combined%20Ballot%20Count%20Report_6.8.2022.pdf' target='_blank'>election officials</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Alaskans will rank the four finalists in August.

He said that judging by how much money is being spent on ads in the Las Vegas media market by political committees aligned with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Democrats are worried about losing the three Las Vegas-area House seats.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Well, why don’t you ask Nancy? ...

Romano, who is an independent but planning to vote Republican this year, said that although he believes Donald Trump as president was “too brusque” and “caused damage,” people will remember how the economy thrived under his administration.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The Democrats, this time around, have disappointed us.

People felt strong and safer.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But it’s not a sure bet for Republicans, either.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Zoila Sanchez, who organizes the Hispanics in Politics event, has sensed that those who are open to the GOP have recoiled after being reminded how the Republican Party often responds after a mass shooting. Las Vegas remains the scene of the largest mass shooting in the United States: the 2017 attack in which a man firing from a hotel window killed 60 people and injured more than 400 attending a music festival.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Democratic candidates have heard concerns from voters, especially suburban mothers, on school safety since the shooting in Uvalde, Tex., last month and a leaked Supreme Court draft showing the possible imminent reversal of the 1973 court decision in <i>Roe v.

Handguns are already subject to a federal 21-and-over age limit.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Other provisions could funnel billions of new federal dollars into mental health care and into school security programs, funding new campus infrastructure and armed officers. Several senators last week said they expected one cornerstone of the deal would be legislation sponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) to <a href='https://www.blunt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/blunt-stabenow-announce-new-bill-to-expand-community-mental-health-and-addiction-services-nationwide' target='_blank'>establish a nationwide network</a> of “community behavioral health clinics.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The announcement Sunday represents the fruit of a crash bipartisan effort launched in the days after the May 24 killing of 19 children and two teachers inside Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, which itself came 10 days after another shocking mass shooting inside a Buffalo supermarket.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It also comes one day after <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/11/march-for-our-lives-dc-protests/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14' target='_blank'>thousands attended pro-gun-control rallies</a> across the country organized by the student-led March for Our Lives group, including a Washington event on the National Mall.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Sunday, each senator publicly sketched out a negotiating position in general terms.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Murphy, who has led Democrats’ efforts on gun legislation since the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., said during an anti-gun-violence rally Friday that he was determined to break congressional stasis on gun legislation, but not at any cost: “I’m not interested in doing something unless that’s something is going to save lives, unless that something’s going to be impactful and meaningful.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Meanwhile, Cornyn, who has an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association, said last week that he is interested in forging a compromise, but only if it preserves gun owners’ rights under the Second Amendment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This is not about creating new restrictions on law-abiding citizens,” he said. 'It’s about ensuring that the system we already have in place works as intended.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Key pitfalls remain: Only a handful of the 50 Republican senators were involved in the negotiating group, and under the Senate’s filibuster rule, at least 10 would have to join with the 50 members of the Democratic caucus to advance any legislation. Red-flag laws, in particular, have <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/09/senate-red-flag-laws/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>raised many conservative Republicans’ hackles</a>, though negotiators said last week they believed there would be sufficient GOP support to pass any deal.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The people involved in the talks said it remained unclear how many senators would ultimately sign the statement Sunday morning. One said there were still hopes of having at least 10 Republicans on board, signaling a clear path to passage.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Furthermore, the framework set to be announced Sunday amounts to a statement of principles, not a fully written bill. While people involved in the process said last week that significant chunks of the legislation have already been written, new points of friction frequently arise in Congress as the drafting process is finalized.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden, who gave a White House address earlier this month calling for tough new firearms restrictions, voiced support for the rallies and for “commonsense gun safety legislation” Saturday in a Twitter post: “I join them by repeating my call to Congress: do something.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) signaled Friday that the Democratic-controlled House would move to enact whatever bill the Senate managed to pass. “If it’s life-saving and can make a difference, and they have bipartisan support for it, then we would welcome it, even though it won’t be everything that we want,” she said at a news conference.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House has already passed four gun-related bills that go considerably further than the tentative Senate deal. Last year, lawmakers passed a bill expanding federal background checks to all commercial transactions, including those conducted at gun shows and over the internet, as well as a measure extending the period the FBI has to complete background checks for gun buyers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Also last week, in response to the recent shootings, the House passed bills that based sales of many semiautomatic rifles to those under 21, banned high-capacity magazines and promoted red-flag laws in both state and federal courts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>None of those bills has the requisite Republican support to pass the Senate.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The last substantial new federal gun control laws were passed in the mid-1990s — the “Brady bill” of 1993, which created the national instant background check system, and the assault weapons ban of 1994, which outlawed some military-style semiautomatic rifles and handguns. The latter bill expired 10 years later and has not been renewed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In recent decades, Washington has acted mainly to expand gun rights. In 2005, for instance, Congress immunized the firearms industry against product liability lawsuits, and in 2008, the Supreme Court enshrined an individual’s right to possess guns in the landmark case <i>D.C. v. Heller</i>. A 2013 push in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to expand background checks to cover more gun transactions, including gun-show and internet sales, <a href='https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1131/vote_113_1_00097.htm' target='_blank'>fell six votes short</a> in the Senate.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Senate returns to session Monday, and while Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) did not lay out any ultimatums last week on timing, he urged the negotiators to act quickly.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>in an interview Thursday, Murphy said he believed that the chamber had two weeks left to act — before lawmakers leave Washington for a two-week Independence Day recess.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But meeting even that timeline would require a framework for a deal to be put in place quickly, Murphy said, citing the likelihood that gun-rights supporters in the Senate would seek to erect procedural hurdles to any potential legislation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We can’t come to agreement the last week we’re here,” he said. “There are people in the Senate that are no doubt going to use every rule available to them to hold this up and slow it down.”</p>"

On ABC News’s “This Week,” Rep. Adam B.

On ABC News’s “This Week,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said that there was credible evidence that Trump committed multiple federal crimes and that it would be up to the Justice Department to make a decision about whether it could prove that to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The evidence is very powerful that Donald Trump began telling this big lie even before the election that he was saying that any ballots counted after Election Day were going to be inherently suspect,” Schiff said, referring to Trump’s baseless claims that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 election. “That lie continued after the election and, ultimately, led to this mob assembling and attacking the Capitol.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) acknowledged that there was no specific statutory provision for just referring crimes by a former president to the Justice Department.

He heard it from all of the lawyers who threatened to resign if he staged his little mini-coup against the Department of Justice by installing someone that would go along with his fairy tale about there having been electoral fraud and corruption,” Raskin said. “So, yes, I think any reasonable person in America will tell you he had to have known he was spreading a big lie. And he continues to spread it to this very day. He continues to foist that propaganda on his followers.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Both Raskin and Schiff said the hearings this week would also provide proof that multiple House Republicans sought pardons from the Trump White House for trying to overturn the election, dismissing the denials of some of those GOP lawmakers, including Rep.

After returning to the White House, he hauled his senior staff, including chief of staff Ron Klain, into the Oval Office, badgering them with questions about the purpose of the event.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden had worried even before the announcement that it exaggerated ethanol’s ability to cut gas prices and could harm his climate goals, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and other officials urged Biden to go, arguing that it would at least help the Midwest — and the White House, after all, was desperate for ways to lower gas prices.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The episode illustrates the White House’s months-long challenge to dampen rising prices, and the president’s increasing frustration with his administration’s inability to do so. The problem has ballooned over the last year, consuming the president’s top aides and threatening his domestic agenda, his international priorities and his party’s political prospects.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Inflation is the bane of our existence,” Biden said last week on Jimmy Kimmel’s show.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Klain and other top officials have directed agency heads to look for any and all steps they might take to lower costs for Americans. Biden is increasingly voicing his anger internally. And some Democrats, inside and outside the White House, want to focus on oil and gas company greed as a centerpiece of their fall message.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a speech Friday at the Port of Los Angeles, Biden renewed an attack on large corporations for ostensibly keeping prices high to boost profits, saying that made him so mad he wanted to “pop” someone. “Exxon made more money than God last year,” Biden said. “Exxon — start investing and start paying your taxes.” Oil companies deny their policies are keeping prices artificially high.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But there is little evidence any of this is working. And some economists say the unusual nature of this inflationary run makes it particularly stubborn.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think we’re in a really difficult position, because we don’t have successful precedents for having an economy this red hot in terms of low unemployment and high inflation and not having a recession,” former treasury secretary Larry Summers said. “It’s going to very, very difficult to achieve a soft landing.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If anything, the problem appears to be accelerating. Prices <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/10/inflation-may-cpi-fed-gas-prices/?itid=lk_inline_manual_17' target='_blank'>rose 8.6 percent in May</a>, the highest level in 40 years, according to the latest consumer price index released Friday. Moreover, prices climbed more quickly last month than they did in April, denting the optimism in the White House that the country had already hit its inflationary peak.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Gas prices, the most visible sign of spiking prices, have skyrocketed, with the national average for a gallon of gas hitting $4.99, according to AAA. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended global energy markets, further disrupting supply chains already in disarray because of the pandemic. Western sanctions against Moscow as punishment for the war have also dramatically increased costs.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Americans are feeling the price hikes across the board: the cost of food, shelter, airfare, medical care and clothing have all increased. And as prices continue to rise, economic head winds are overshadowing and redirecting the president’s agenda on all fronts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Sen. Joe Manchin III (<a href='http://D-W.Va' target='_blank'>D-W.Va</a>.) torpedoed the president’s sweeping economic plan in part because of  concerns over inflation. The president has changed his approach to Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, after vowing as a candidate to treat the country as a “pariah.' And his approval rating continues to drop, as voters increasingly sour on his handling of the economy.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/09/inflation-worse-poll-americans/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24'>new poll</a> from The Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government found most Americans expect prices will continue to rise in the next year and are changing their spending habits as a result. Republicans continue to seize on the issue as evidence of Democrats’ failed stewardship of the economy, with the congressional elections now less than five months away.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As administration officials increasingly conclude there is little they can do to affect prices, they are at least trying to change their messaging — for example, touting the positive indicators in the economy, chiefly a near-record-low<b> </b>unemployment rate. But as Americans grapple with the rising costs of everyday items, the argument does not seem to be resonating.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The White House made a fresh push last month to show that Biden and his team were hard at work trying to rein in inflation. The president met with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the Oval Office and penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, while the White House sent officials across the cable networks to outline the actions the administration was taking.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Biden and his aides have also taken to attacking Republicans more vigorously, focusing especially on a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/02/23/rick-scott-campaign-plan/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29' target='_blank'>proposal published by Republican Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.)</a> that Democrats argue would  make things worse by raising taxes on many Americans.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the messaging push has not yielded any new direct measures to lower costs.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Jason Furman, a professor at Harvard University and former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, has long criticized the size of the coronavirus stimulus package Democrats passed at the start of Biden’s tenure, arguing it contributed to inflation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But he said the administration has largely done what it could to reduce costs since then, although he questioned the prolonged moratorium on student debt repayments and the maintenance of tariffs on China. Restarting student loan payments and taking away some tariffs, Furman argued, could help alleviate the problem.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Furman also said there is a mismatch between the public anger about inflation and how much Biden can do about it. “There is nothing Americans are more mad about than gas prices,” he said. “It’s one of the things the White House has very little power over. It’s a global price, and it’s driven by global events.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The administration has also struggled to explain how long Americans should expect to see rising prices, giving an inaccurate sense that the rapid price increases would subside relatively quickly. When prices first start increasing markedly last year, Biden and others suggested it was the result of the economy’s rapid reopening after the pandemic and would fade as the economy stabilized.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The price hikes “are expected to be temporary,” Biden said in July 2021, a prediction echoed by top aides who promised inflation would be “transitory.” In recent months, these officials have changed their tune, and late last month, Biden started saying inflation was his “top economic priority.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Furman said the administration’s early analysis of the problem tracked with most estimates, including the Federal Reserve.
