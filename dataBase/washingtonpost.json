So Biden is promising big savings.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But it turns out the White House has been engaging in some inflation of its own.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If that $500 figure appears familiar, it’s because you heard something similar in the president’s <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/' target='_blank'>State of the Union address</a> on March 1. He said his American Rescue Plan would “cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combating climate change.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That figure was a reference to <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf' target='_blank'>a report</a> published in October by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Rhodium predicted that if Biden’s climate change policies were adopted, <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=23' target='_blank'>by 2030</a> “national average annual household energy costs” would be “roughly $500 lower than under current policy.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>First of all, that’s eight years from now — not a lot of help with the current inflation problem, which was the frame of Biden’s op-ed. But the bigger problem is that “national average annual household energy costs” is not the same thing as household utility bills.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://rhg.com/team/john-larsen/' target='_blank'>John Larsen</a>, a Rhodium partner and principal author of the report, said the estimate includes both home energy services and the cost of driving. The two elements are roughly equal in terms of energy costs of $4,163 — $2,126 for mobility and $2,037 for home energy. (Note that the home energy element is similar to the EnergyStar estimate.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But most of the estimated savings, Larsen said, comes from the driving side of the equation. “Of the $495 in savings, $403 comes from mobility savings (spending less money on gasoline either because of more efficient cars or electric vehicles) and the remainder is home energy savings,” he wrote in an email.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Indeed, the report <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=24' target='_blank'>notes</a> that, if the Biden climate plan were adopted, home electricity bills by 2030 would be between one dollar more and five dollars less than under current policy. That might pay for an extra ice cream cone over the summer.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Larsen noted that Biden, in the op-ed, referred to learning this number in a conversation with utility executives, so he did not appear to be referencing the Rhodium report. “I can say that our numbers represent savings across all household energy expenditures and not just those associated with utility bills,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But when we located <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-roundtable-with-ceos-of-electric-utilities-to-discuss-his-build-back-better-agenda/' target='_blank'>the transcript</a> of Biden’s conversation with utility executives on Feb. 9, we found no reference to $500 in utility savings.

They’ve <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-national-divide/2021/09/05/24165092-0b4e-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_41&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>increased the penalties</a> for supposed wrongdoing by election administrators.

Some doubt, for instance, the impact that canvassers can have when it comes to not certifying a vote — given that such canvassers’ jobs are generally ministerial. Even poll workers who raise a fuss about mundane vote-counting issues could see their efforts rebuffed by the courts when push comes to shove, as they were in 2020. It’s possible the 2024 election won’t be close enough for any of this to matter, and that the fever in the GOP surrounding voter fraud could break if, for instance, Trump fades politically.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But one of the lessons of 2020 is that the few Republicans who clearly rebuked Trump’s claim were, not coincidentally, disproportionately those who were <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/08/gop-officials-overwhelmingly-side-against-trumps-voter-fraud-claims-when-forced-decide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>forced to actually take a position by virtue of their official duties</a>. Such people have since been weeded out, often through targeting in GOP primaries, but also through attrition (such as election workers <a href='https://apnews.com/article/election-officials-retire-trump-2020-threats-misinformation-3b810d8b3b3adee2ca409689788b863f' target='_blank'>heading for the exits because of threats</a>); in several cases Republicans have warmed to voter-fraud claims they <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/07/gop-candidates-election-claims/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>never endorsed back in 2020</a>. The pressure has been palpable, and it’s manifested itself in a number of ways that matter, irrespective of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/georgia-texas-primaries-takeaways/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>Raffensperger somehow managing to win renomination</a> last week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The problem with telling that story — of how democracy could be undermined at the grass roots — is that it’s very difficult to get a handle on it in any truly authoritative and quantitative way; it depends so much on the views of people whose views have never been recorded, because nobody outside of a select few even know who they are.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But there is little doubt about what kinds of people will be drawn to these lower-level positions, because we’re seeing what kinds of people are being drawn into running for similar, higher-profile roles.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And the problem could go beyond poll workers raising legally valid complaints or canvassers and secretaries of state refusing to certify results. As we saw in 2020, the simple presence of enough smoke and misinformation was enough to get state and congressional Republicans to seriously consider overriding the vote totals in certain states. The effort to get GOP-run state legislatures to send alternate slates of electors and Congress to reject the results on Jan. 6 was haphazard and didn’t pan out, but we’re in a very different environment even than we were then.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And if enough election truthers are in place to color the process from the grass-roots level up — in a way they failed to in 2020 when the groundwork wasn’t yet laid — it’s not so difficult to see Republicans justifying decisions to themselves that they didn’t in 2020. Because if there’s one thing the Trump era has reinforced, it’s that these things often flow up from the bottom.</p>"

Ennis, as a member of the inspectors general council’s Integrity Committee, must recuse herself from all committee matters while the investigation is ongoing.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Lerner declined to comment on the investigation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the heart of the investigation is the<b> </b>Civil Monetary Penalty Program, a little-known anti-fraud program run by the inspector general’s office. During the Trump administration, under Ennis’s watch, the program began levying unprecedented fines, which reached hundreds of thousands of dollars, on more than 100 people accused of improperly receiving disability benefits. The fines were imposed without considering the age, financial condition or other mitigating factors of the recipients — a departure from how the program had previously operated.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Many of those fined had no hope of ever being able to pay. Over a seven-month period that ended in mid-2019, 83 people were charged a total of $11.5 million, documents obtained by The Post showed — a jump from less than $700,000 for all of 2017.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Civil fines are supposed to provide an alternative when fraud is considered too insignificant to warrant criminal prosecution by the Justice Department. In years past, cases had often settled, with agreements for drastically lower fines as claimants gradually paid back what they owed taxpayers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>On Thursday, the staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform and Ways and Means committees will summon two of Ennis’s deputies to brief them on how the fines escalated, and about the treatment of two senior officials on Ennis’s staff who raised repeated concerns about the penalties.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Those senior officials were then abruptly placed on administrative leave, with one fired and the other demoted. Both are back at work, one after settling a whistleblower case with the agency. The other, attorney Deborah Shaw, in May was found by an administrative law judge at the Merit Systems Protection Board to have been the victim of “whistleblower reprisal” by Ennis’s office.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Office of Special Counsel, a small independent agency that investigates complaints of retaliation against whistleblowers who report waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, also has opened a case after receiving multiple complaints that employees who work for Ennis have suffered reprisals, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. A spokesman for Special Counsel Henry Kerner declined to comment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Ennis’s chief counsel on Wednesday told the attorneys who work in the civil penalty program to stop issuing fines until further notice while Kijakazi’s staff conducts a thorough review of the program, which was delegated to the inspector general’s office when it started in 1995.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Top House Democrats welcomed the new investigation by CIGIE.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“It’s a welcome first step in understanding who has been harmed by the apparent abuses by Social Security’s Office of the Inspector General, and to what extent,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E.

Connolly (D-Va.), who leads the government operations panel on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in a statement that “inspectors general must be pure as driven snow” and said other watchdogs have lingered in their positions for years while the council investigated.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>“</i>Congress is watching, and our oversight Subcommittee is prepared to take appropriate, swift action,” Connolly wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The investigation is likely to be far-reaching. The troubled anti<b>-</b>fraud program is one of several controversies roiling Social Security’s 500-person internal watchdog division, charged with oversight of the agency that distributes retirement benefits to 69 million Americans and monthly disability checks to about 15 million others.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Dozens of senior auditors, law enforcement agents and other staff have quit or retired, many in frustration with what they describe as Ennis’s mercurial leadership and lack of focus on the office’s mission, according to current and former staff members. Ennis has defended her leadership and said some employees bristle at changes when a new leader comes in.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Audits have also plummeted. So has morale, which has taken a nosedive in successive surveys of the federal workforce since Ennis took over. New data for 2021 collected by the Office of Personnel Management for the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) and released internally Tuesday shows 28 percent of those who responded consider the inspector general’s office a good place to work, with 13 percent agreeing that their senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment. And 22 percent said senior leaders maintained high standards of honesty and integrity.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rose, a spokeswoman for Ennis, called the inspector general’s staff “our most valuable resource in accomplishing our mission” and said the office has made efforts to “improve workplace engagement” for several years. “We are analyzing the 2021 FEVS survey results,” she wrote.</p>"

The state Supreme Court in 1989 invalidated a law requiring minors to obtain parental consent to get an abortion based on the provision that states that every “person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into his private life.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The court’s ruling stated that it could “conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning one’s body that one can make in the course of a lifetime.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Florida has some of the least restrictive abortion laws in the southeast.

Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, said the new law is at odds with the “Florida value around privacy, around personal medical decisions, including someone’s pregnancy.

The legislature, they said, passed a law that will “unlawfully intrude upon the fundamental privacy rights of Florida women. It will deny Floridians’ autonomy over their own bodies and undermine their ability to make deeply personal decisions about their lives, families, and health care free of government interference.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a statement Wednesday, the governor’s office said DeSantis is “confident that this law will ultimately withstand all legal challenges.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an antiabortion organization, characterizes to the state’s abortion protections as an “artificial superpowered abortion right,” more expansive than the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Roe </i>and subsequent decisions.

More than enough to make a guy cranky.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But this is not just any guy. It’s Gregg Phillips, the guy who, in D’Souza’s film and at hearings in front of friendly state legislatures, has used intentionally pejorative language to cast his perceived opponents as criminals or dangerous. The people carrying ballots — which, if it occurred, wasn’t even illegal in two of the states True the Vote and D’Souza looked at — are “mules,” as in drug mules. The places where they allegedly collected these ballots (a part of the process left completely unproven in the film) become “stash houses.” All of it, he has declared, showed “organized crime.” It’s not subtle.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>During a hearing before legislators in Arizona on Tuesday, Phillips applied that same tactic to members of the media.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think somebody wrote — the New York Times or someone — wrote, well, you can tell that they’re walking down the street, but you can’t see which side of the street they’re on,” he said. “Utter nonsense. It’s complete nonsense. They’re asking the wrong questions. They’re asking the wrong people.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“These articles are being written by journalistic terrorists,” he added.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Repeat that last line?” a legislator asked — drawing it out for emphasis, as she later made clear.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Yeah,” Phillips said. “The articles are being written by journalistic terrorists, of which I think are probably one or two in this room.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kelli Ward, chair of the Republican Party in the state, liked that phrase.</p><div data-oembed-type='twitter' class='' style='min-height:171px'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>False Information being written and disseminated by “journalistic terrorists” like some of these👇🏼👇🏼 <a href='https://t.co/qTUxmfqQJc'>pic.twitter.com/qTUxmfqQJc</a></p>— Dr. Kelli Ward 🇺🇸 (@kelliwardaz) <a href='https://twitter.com/kelliwardaz/status/1531778377605976064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>May 31, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async='' src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script>\n</div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In addition to retweeting Ward, the state party went further, <a href='https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/media/2022/05/31/arizona-republican-party-media-are-domestic-terrorists-tweet/7463139001/' target='_blank'>declaring</a> that the “mainstream media is Domestic Terrorists.” It later deleted that and another similar tweet.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What’s remarkable about Phillips’s comment isn’t simply how astonishingly over-the-top it was, or even how it made obvious his predilection for exaggerating nefariousness. What’s remarkable is that the new presentation did little to nothing to actually address the valid questions about his purported research. In fact, he made a comment that significantly <i>weakened</i> his case.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At issue is the reliability of his analysis of data collected from cellphones. The idea that thousands of people were ferrying ballots around battleground states depends on the regularity of those phones being in proximity to places with ballot drop boxes. Phillips and his supporters have regularly tried to suggest that people who doubt his analysis are casting doubt on the ability of phones to precisely geolocate someone, which is not the case. But it is the case that there’s good reason to think that Phillips’s analyses don’t include precise measurements of proximity to ballot drop boxes.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Consider what actually determining that someone visited a drop box would require. You’d need a precise measurement of location from the phone and you’d need to know precisely where the drop box was. In other words, you’d need to know that the phone was within a foot or two of a space that itself is only a few square feet. Not only will experts tell you that most cellphone geolocation data is not sufficiently precise, there’s no indication that the True the Vote people even knew where drop boxes were located at the libraries and government offices that hosted them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The best indication we have of what True the Vote was looking at comes from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which in September <a href='https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1451309892824936452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1451309892824936452%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpb.org%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2Fgbi-says-gops-cellphone-data-lacks-enough-evidence-prove-ballot-harvesting' target='_blank'>determined</a> that the data it was provided was insufficient to launch an investigation. The GBI said that the data was “cell site location information” — a triangulated location estimate less accurate than GPS — and that it centered on identifying visits “within 100 feet of a voter drop box.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That’s significantly less precise than Phillips likes to suggest. During his testimony in Arizona, in fact, Phillips insisted that the military could get GPS precision down to a few centimeters. And <a href='https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/#difference' target='_blank'>that’s true</a> — using specific technology that’s not generally available commercially. Using technology that there’s no reason to think he had. Instead, he insisted that by overlapping different bits of data — WiFi access and Bluetooth — he could get more precise. That’s not what the GBI says it received.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At one point, True the Vote’s team showed this map, purporting to show one person’s movements in Yuma County, Ariz.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This is a sample pattern of life for one device in Yuma County from October 7th through November 3rd,” Phillips’s colleague Catherine Engelbrecht said. “This device went to 77 unique drop boxes. And you can see in the lower right where those locations were.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Beyond all of the other questions that naturally arise — like, why bother going to different drop boxes, particularly in less-populated areas? — the data appear to show cellphone pings of someone who lives in Yuma (at top center) and occasionally drives around the region. Do those blue dots correspond to clear visits to libraries? Or more accurately, to visits to drop boxes at those libraries? Not to mention that Yuma County’s 2020 voter guide doesn’t include locations like the Foothills Library (at 13226 S. Frontage Rd. in Yuma) on its <a href='https://www.yumacountyaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=41773' target='_blank'>list of drop-off locations</a>. We’re just meant to take Phillips’s and Engelbrecht’s word for it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That’s what D’Souza did. I <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/discussing-gaps-2000-mules-with-dinesh-dsouza/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>spoke to him</a> about the movie and about Phillips’s data, repeatedly pressing him on questions about credibility. I asked him, for example, how he could be confident that people shown in the movie dropping off ballots were actually “mules,” given that there was no evidence provided for their having gone to more than one drop box. Considering one example of a guy on a bike dropping off a ballot, I pointed out to D’Souza that, beyond Phillips suggesting that the guy was being paid to deposit the ballot, the movie makes no direct claim and offers no evidence that he’s a “mule.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Of course there is a claim being made!” D’Souza insisted. “The context of the movie is to explain that that’s the search criterion. All the mules being counted under that rubric went to 10 or more drop boxes.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Fine. But in Arizona, Phillips made a different claim — to again disparage journalists.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“One of the fallacies in people evaluating and fact-checking the movie,” he said, “really centered around a couple of videos that were out there of people shoving a whole bunch of ballots in.” That would presumably include the guy on the bike, who Phillips claimed (though it’s not apparent in the video) pulls “ballots” out of his backpack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Interestingly, only one of those people actually was a mule,” he continued, “because they didn’t meet the standard of having to get inside 10 times and go to one of the [nonprofit organizations] five times.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>You got that? Fact checks <a href='https://www.ajc.com/politics/what-2000-mules-leaves-out-from-ballot-harvesting-claims/FFMNUU56RVBRNOLZKWHUREQPEU/' target='_blank'>pointing out</a> that the people included in the film “2000 Mules” were not actually mules were flawed because only one of the people shown in the film actually met Phillips’s “mule” standard anyway. (An email to Phillips asking him to identify which person was the mule did not receive a response by the time of publication though he later wrote to say the quote was “out of context.”)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The person shown in the movie before the guy on the bike, incidentally, was a woman who Engelbrecht claimed had visited “dozens and dozens” of drop boxes in both the 2020 presidential election and the Georgia Senate runoff in January 2021. So is she the sole mule? Or was Engelbrecht offering <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/even-geolocation-maps-2000-mules-are-misleading/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45' target='_blank'>another misrepresentation</a> to viewers? And if so, did D’Souza know?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s because of things like this that reporters urge caution in viewing the movie or in taking Phillips’s claims at face value. And it’s because we urge caution that Phillips compares us to people who use violence to evoke fear.</p>"

The toll was higher in 2020, the first year of the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7' target='_blank' class='contextual_link'>coronavirus</a> pandemic. That year was <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/' target='_blank'>the deadliest for gun violence</a> on record.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>While the increase in 2020 was a function of an increase in homicides and accidental shootings, it was still the case that about half of the recorded deaths were suicides.

A few weeks after the election was over, the first reports about that interference emerged, prompting Trump — smarting over having lost the popular vote — to disparage the idea that his victory was a function of anything other than his own aptitude. When BuzzFeed published the dossier of reports compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, Trump’s fury escalated. The Russia allegations were a “WITCH HUNT,” he wrote for the first time that same day. On the day following, he suggested that intelligence agencies had released the document, an act akin to “living in Nazi Germany.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was more than a week before he even became president.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over time, a pattern emerged. Trump would make broad claims about how investigations into Russian interference — and, we later learned, contacts between his campaign team and Russian actors — were contrived to damage him personally. His allies would then scramble to prove him right either in the abstract or to validate the specific claims he had made, however loosely they could.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And over and over and over those efforts to cast Trump as the victim of a plot aimed at undermining his candidacy or his presidency came up short.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Two things bear mentioning at the outset. It is true that the investigation into Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team suffered from flaws and errors. It’s quite possible that no massive investigation could escape some level of error of the sorts exposed by the scrutiny paid to the Russia investigation, but it is true that the scrutiny paid here did reveal questionable actions and decisions that don’t alter our understanding of what occurred.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The other thing worth mentioning is that the details were never the point. Trump’s play from the outset was to raise doubt and then simply refit the evidence as needed. His supporters always champion how he turned out to be “right” about various things, a function of ignoring all the times he was obviously wrong — the kid guessing a number between 1 and 10 who guesses each number and then claims he nailed it. The operating assumption is that Trump is right about being unfairly targeted by the Russia probe and so any new claim that bolsters that assumption is elevated — even after being debunked — until a new, not-yet-debunked claim emerges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What triggered the Russia investigation is simple. Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election both through the much-hyped but less-significant effort to contribute to the social media conversation and through the hacking of the Democratic Party and a top adviser to Hillary Clinton. As this was known to be going on, federal investigators began investigating whether people close to Trump might have been actively working with Russia. People like Paul Manafort, his campaign manager and consultant to Russia-linked actors; and like Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser who had previously been identified as a target for Russian intelligence efforts and who traveled to Moscow in early July 2016; and like George Papadopoulos, another adviser who had been told by a guy who was helping him set up a meeting between Trump and Russia’s president that Russia had some of Clinton’s emails. That Russia had hacked the Democrats was known by mid-June 2016 and the Russia probe was opened by the end of July.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the years since, that simple explanation for the investigation has been muddied by a variety of alternate theories, claims that objective analysis has shown to be either false or irrelevant to the central question.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These are those claims.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One of the first egregious claims Trump made about the Russia investigation was that it involved having the “wires tapped” at Trump Tower during the campaign. This would become a pattern: Trump would take <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/14/why-trump-is-once-again-claiming-that-he-was-spied-upon-2016/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>an overblown claim</a> from conservative media and inflate it further. (There is no evidence that Trump Tower was wiretapped; the government has repeatedly denied that it did so.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Within days, Trump was <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/29/the-nunes-white-house-question-assessed-minute-by-minute/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>claiming</a> that his unfounded assertion was proved right not by evidence of wiretapping but by evidence that communications involving a member of his transition team, Michael Flynn, had been “unmasked” by the administration of Barack Obama. It’s always been odd to try to conflate this with wiretapping Trump Tower unless you recognize the intermediate step: Trump Tower was wiretapped, meaning that Trump was spied on, meaning that anyone working with Trump being spied on validates the claim. This is how it works.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The “Flynn unmasking” argument was clunky, too, because it depended on understanding how surveillance works. The government monitors communications with people like the Russian ambassador. But since the CIA and NSA aren’t supposed to surveil American citizens, the identities of Americans talking to the ambassador are “masked,” which is to say anonymized. Other officials can ask that the identity be unmasked, however, to understand who’s talking to that ambassador in the first place. Which Obama officials did, learning the person talking to Russia’s ambassador was Flynn. (Incidentally, Flynn had visited Moscow in late 2015, sitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696' target='_blank'>at a dinner</a>.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was trumpeted repeatedly as the Obama administration spying on Flynn and, therefore, Trump. But a review from Trump’s own Justice Department later determined that there was <a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'>no evidence</a> that the unmasking was politically motivated. That Flynn later lied to investigators about the conversation, though, led to his pleading guilty to making false statements.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Shortly after the “unmasking” brouhaha, Trump’s irritation about the Russia probe led him to fire FBI Director James B. Comey (though Trump claimed this was about how the FBI handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server). Shortly thereafter, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was assigned to investigate Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team — an assignment made by a Trump appointee aimed at protecting the investigation from interference.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the public sphere, the dossier published by BuzzFeed had attracted outsize attention, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>despite obvious questions</a> about what it alleged. Most media outlets treated it with skepticism or treated it as unconfirmed. As time passed and many of its claims remained unsubstantiated or had been undermined, it gained unexpected importance — among Trump’s <i>defenders</i>. After all, if the dossier could be identified as the primary trigger for the Russia probe and it was contrived, that made the entire investigation dubious.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This line of argument became more appealing after it was learned that Steele had been hired by a firm called Fusion GPS that was itself hired by a law firm working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party. The line of argument skipped a few middle steps to become that Clinton had paid for a dossier of false claims — perhaps itself seeded by Russian intelligence! — and triggered the Russia probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The problem is that this assertion both ignores the known predicates for the Russia probe, and it doesn’t fit with the timeline of when the probe began. The FBI didn’t obtain the dossier until <a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'>mid-September 2016</a>, according to an internal inspector general report, after the Russia investigation was already underway.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In 2018, it was revealed that the dossier had been an important part of an application to obtain a warrant surveilling Carter Page. That warrant, obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), included allegations from the dossier as a reason to surveil him. (The application acknowledged that Steele was “was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit” Trump’s campaign.) The warrant was granted and later renewed several times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Only after Page left the campaign, however. When allegations from the Steele dossier were made public (apparently by Steele), Page resigned from the campaign. It was after that point that the surveillance warrant was granted. This problem with the timeline has been attributed to some multidimensional chess — that the warrant was a back door to investigate others close to Trump, for example — but that Page had previously been identified by a Russian intelligence agent as <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/15/politics/russia-spy-recruitment-tactics-fbi-carter-page/index.html' target='_blank'>a possible recruitment target</a> seems salient.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The dossier’s allegations have by now been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/23/steele-dossier-igor-danchenko-indictment-scrutiny/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>shown to not be credible</a>. There are valid questions about including its claims in the FISA warrant. But neither that warrant nor the dossier itself were predicates for the Russia investigation itself. For years, Trump and his allies have claimed that the Russia investigation stemmed from the dossier <i>because</i> it was sketchy and <i>because</i> it was paid for indirectly by lawyers working for Clinton. But that doesn’t make it true.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A few months after Mueller took over the Russia investigation, we learned that an FBI officials working on his team had been removed. That official, Peter Strzok, was a counterintelligence officer who had also been central to launching Crossfire Hurricane — the internal code name for the Russia investigation — in the first place. He was removed by Mueller after it was discovered that he had exchanged messages disparaging Trump and other elected officials with another FBI official, Lisa Page.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Those messages launched a slew of arguments aimed at undermining the Russia investigation broadly. Strzok was accused of ginning up the probe out of animus toward Trump, a belief that a later investigation by the Justice Department inspector general <a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'>found to be unwarranted</a>. His exchange with Page in which he referred to the need to probe possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia as being akin to a young person getting an “insurance policy” was repeatedly cited as evidence he wanted to blackmail Trump — although he <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/14/what-strzok-page-insurance-policy-text-was-actually-about/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40' target='_blank'>explained credibly under oath</a> that he was simply stating that they couldn’t allow the possibility of a connection to go unexamined in the event that Trump  won (which at the time seemed unlikely).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The huge trove of messages (which, despite a different set of rumors, were <a href='https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-8227360079' target='_blank'>not intentionally destroyed</a>) allowed for Trump supporters to pick out various phrases as sinister or significant even when they weren’t. There was a brief flurry of attention paid to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/24/russia-probe-theories-that-trump-has-empowered-barr-investigate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41' target='_blank'>a message about “OCONUS lures”</a> — an apparent reference to informants outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). But this was part of Strzok’s job and was not shown to be related to the Russia probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That particular idea gained some traction after it was revealed that the FBI had <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is-no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>employed a confidential informant</a> to probe members of Trump’s team. This was dubbed Spygate and became Trump’s new explanation for how he was right about having been under surveillance all along. (Trump <a href='https://apnews.com/23b9456c12484b6cb31c93da269a6159/Seething-over-Russia-probe,-Trump-tears-into-%27spygate' target='_blank'>told an ally</a> that he liked to call the informant a “spy” specifically for the pejorative connotations.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That informant, though, reached out to Carter Page and George Papadopoulos only after they were already on the FBI’s radar screen. That same inspector general report determined that there was “no evidence that the FBI used CHSs” — confidential human sources — “or UCEs” — undercover employees — “to interact with members of the Trump campaign prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“After the opening of the investigation,” it continues, “we found no evidence that the FBI placed any CHSs or UCEs within the Trump campaign or tasked any CHSs or UCEs to report on the Trump campaign.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As should be obvious, that inspector general report did a lot to undercut the narratives promoted by Trump and his allies. So, as soon as it came out, Attorney General William P. Barr released a statement in concert with U.S. Attorney John Durham <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/barr-durham-ig-report-russia-investigation.html' target='_blank'>undercutting its determinations</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>By then, Durham had already been tapped to conduct an investigation into the investigation: to figure out whether Trump’s efforts to cast himself as unfairly targeted held water. The inspector general report, by making an objective assessment that it didn’t, stepped on Durham’s (and therefore Barr’s and therefore Trump’s) toes, hence the statement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Durham and Barr began scouring the available evidence, going so far as to <a href='https://www.thedailybeast.com/barr-went-to-rome-to-hear-a-secret-tape-from-joseph-mifsud-the-professor-who-helped-ignite-the-russia-probe' target='_blank'>travel to Italy</a> to evaluate whether the understood predicate for the investigation — Papadopoulos being told that Russia had Clinton emails — was valid. But, for months, no alternate explanation emerged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Before Trump left office, Durham’s role was shifted to special counsel, giving him the same protection from President Biden that Mueller had from Trump. But Durham has not produced much. He obtained an <a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/russian-national-indicted-making-false-statements-fbi' target='_blank'>indictment</a> against Igor Danchenko, one of the sources for the Steele dossier and one <a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/grand-jury-indicts-dc-attorney-making-false-statements-fbi-2016-regarding-alleged' target='_blank'>against an attorney</a> who worked for the law firm employed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Which brings us to this week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In October 2020, the campaign looming, the political ally Trump put in charge of the national intelligence directorate <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'>released a lette</a><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'>r</a> pointedly suggesting that the Russia investigation was a function of Clinton’s campaign. The evidence? Apparently that the CIA had identified discussion among Russian sources alleging that Clinton had approved a campaign message trying to link Trump to Russia on July 26, 2016.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was, in fact, five days before Crossfire Hurricane was launched. But it was after there were already <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/the-trump-russia-money-question-in-24-steps/?itid=lk_inline_manual_58' target='_blank'>numerous public questions</a> about Trump’s connections to and sympathies toward Russia and Putin. That Russia got intelligence that Clinton had made linking Trump to Russia part of her campaign strategy in late July is both unremarkable (her campaign manager, Robby Mook, had already raised it in television interviews) and unrelated to the FBI probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The appeal here is obvious, though, as it was with the Steele dossier. Blaming Clinton for the Russia probe scratches two itches at once: casts Trump as innocent and Clinton as guilty.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Durham’s indictment of Michael Sussman, the attorney who worked for the firm hired by Clinton’s campaign, prompted a flurry of similar allegations. He had come to the FBI with <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?itid=lk_inline_manual_60' target='_blank'>a dubious claim</a> about a connection between Trump’s private company and a Russian bank — which to Trump supporters became proof that Clinton had tried to gin up this controversy and therefore the Russia probe. But that allegation was incidental to the Russia investigation (far more even than the Carter Page FISA warrant), coming months after the investigation began. During Sussman’s trial, Mook testified that Clinton had approved a messaging campaign elevating the dubious claim, an admission that titillated Fox News types. But it was completely irrelevant to the Russia investigation. Like the October 2020 story, it was about campaign messaging, not federal investigations.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Sussman prosecution included other efforts to elevate minor points as dispositive of Trump’s having been unfairly targeted. There was the flutter of excitement over the Trump White House having been surveilled by Sussman as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/18/john-durham-dumps-small-bucket-water-forest-fire-he-sparked/?itid=lk_inline_manual_61' target='_blank'>hinted at in a Durham court filing</a> — but that didn’t happen. Instead, researchers who were clients of Sussman’s had obtained data from the White House during the Obama administration that they had analyzed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One would think that, by that point, Trump’s allies would be skeptical of new assertions about how the Russia investigation began. After all, not only have there been repeated claims about what happened that have been shown to be baseless, but there also has been nothing that has undercut the official story about how the probe began (even after Barr and Durham went to Italy in the apparent hope of doing so).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But, again, the point isn’t the evidence. The point is the belief that Trump was unfairly accused. That belief is not driven by evidence, so it can’t be undercut by a lack of evidence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is still important to note that there is no evidence for it. And not for lack of trying to find some.</p>"

This fed into long-running allegations of the government “spying” on Trump, who chose Flynn as his national security adviser.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We knew before that this theory had fallen apart. We now know just how spectacularly.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>BuzzFeed News late Tuesday revealed <a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'>a previously top-secret Justice Department report</a> that details the findings of a review ordered by Trump’s attorney general, William P.

(Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI about these calls.) And there were valid questions early on about the Obama administration’s use of unmasking, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/04/susan-rice-isnt-a-smoking-gun-but-she-does-have-some-explaining-to-do/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9' target='_blank'>as we wrote in 2017</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the allegations almost always went beyond the known facts.

But speaking to the FBI later, Flynn denied having discussed sanctions. He pleaded guilty to that offense, but Barr’s Justice Department later made the extraordinary decision to try to have the case dismissed, and <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynn-trump-pardon/2020/11/25/3cd79198-2e65-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>a lame-duck President Trump pardoned Flynn</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Bash’s report becomes public after we already knew his review had resulted in no criminal charges.

Often, it wasn’t just “this seems fishy”; it was that “this is a proven scandal.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After Ignatius’s report, a Bloomberg News columnist reported in April 2017 that former Obama national security adviser <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-04-03/top-obama-adviser-sought-names-of-trump-associates-in-intel' target='_blank'>Susan Rice had requested unmaskings</a> in intelligence reports related to Trump’s campaign and transition period.

Robert Wallach, a California lawyer who came to Washington in the early 1980s as an adviser to presidential counselor Edwin Meese III, only to become a central figure in the Reagan-era Wedtech bribery scandal, in which he was first convicted and later freed after defending himself in court, died May 15 at his home in Alameda, Calif. He was 88.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The death was announced by the San Francisco law firm of Rains Lucia Stern, where Mr. Wallach worked in recent years. The cause was not disclosed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Early in his career, Mr. Wallach established a reputation as one of California’s top trial lawyers, winning the state’s first million-dollar settlement in a medical malpractice case, followed by a $3.6 million verdict in New Mexico, after a child suffered brain damage at birth.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In San Francisco, he was known as a liberal Democrat who briefly sought the U.S. Senate nomination in 1976 as a supporter of gay rights and legalized marijuana. By 1980, Mr. Wallach had become a supporter of the presidential campaign of Republican Ronald Reagan, largely because of his friendship with Meese, one of Reagan’s top advisers. Meese had been Mr. Wallach’s law school classmate and moot court partner at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After Reagan’s election, Mr. Wallach came to Washington as an informal adviser to Meese, who was counselor to the president before becoming attorney general in 1985.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was named a U.S. Representative for Human Rights and served on the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, but beyond sharing lunches and memos with Meese, he exercised little real authority.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Early in 1981, Mr. Wallach became the conduit to the Reagan administration for Wedtech, a small manufacturing firm in the Bronx seeking leverage on Pentagon projects. The company’s owners, unschooled in the ways of Washington, had hired a private detective to find out why they weren’t winning defense contracts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I didn’t think investigating the secretary of the Army and some procurement officers was going to help,” the detective, Harold Lipset, told The Washington Post in 1987. “I thought they needed a lobbyist in Washington and [Mr. Wallach] was the only one I knew who knew somebody in Washington.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach, who had spent his early years in New York City, saw the company’s blue-collar executives as the kind of scrappy underdogs he had been as a young man. He wrote memos to Meese touting Wedtech as an inspiring company on the rise, and Reagan praised it in speeches.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over the next few years, Wedtech landed Pentagon contracts worth an estimated $250 million, many of them awarded on a no-bid basis. Mr. Wallach admitted he had pocketed at least $1.3 million in stocks and fees as he helped the company gain a foothold in Washington.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Wedtech struggled to fulfill its contracts, federal prosecutors bought charges of bribery, racketeering and fraud against company officials, who had rewarded themselves with expensive cars and lavish meals. Several political figures were also swept up in the widening scandal, including Mr. Wallach, former White House communications director <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2006/03/28/strategist-reagan-adviser-lyn-nofziger/7b36b6f6-2b87-415a-b7a6-eabe5e94d392/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>Lyn Nofziger</a> and members of Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the end, more than 20 people were convicted in federal court. U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and former Bronx borough president Stanley Simon each spent more than two years in prison on corruption charges. Meese was not prosecuted, but in the midst of the scandal he resigned from his post as attorney general in 1988.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was convicted of racketeering in 1989 and sentenced to six years in prison, leading to the temporary suspension of his law practice in California while he appealed the decision. His conviction was overturned in 1991, after a key witness was found to have committed perjury. (Nofziger and others similarly had their convictions reversed.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Still, Mr. Wallach’s legal troubles were not over, and in 1993 he faced a new trial in New York on similar charges. He refused to make a plea deal, maintaining he had never committed a crime in promoting Wedtech to federal officials.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Having spent more than $1 million on his defense and still owing more than $700,000, Mr. Wallach was reduced to acting as his own attorney almost out of desperation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If I get convicted a second time, I have nothing left,” he said. “I will lose everything, including my livelihood.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When the arguments were finished, the deadlocked jury could not reach a decision. The judge dismissed all charges against Mr. Wallach, who went back to San Francisco to rebuild his career.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Eugene Robert Wallach was born on April 11, 1934, in New York City. His parents worked in a hat factory and divorced when their son was 7.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where she worked in an airplane assembly plant during World War II.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was a champion debater in high school and graduated in 1955 from the University of Southern California. As a law student at Berkeley, he became especially close to Meese, as they studied together in the Meese family basement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I used to love going to their home,” he told journalist James Traub for his 1990 book about the Wedtech scandal, “Too Good to Be True.” “Ed and I were writing briefs down in the basement, his mother would come down with the sandwiches. It was right out of ‘Andy Hardy.’ It was the kind of home I had never experienced.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After graduating in 1958, Mr. Wallach joined a San Francisco law firm, then called Walkup &amp; Downing, and soon became recognized as a top courtroom advocate. He established a solo practice in 1971 and was known for a string of victories, often in cases involving accidents or medical malpractice. One of his courtroom victories, involving Girl Scouts burned in a car crash, led to the adoption of median barriers on some California highways.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“He was known as being the best lawyer in the courtroom in front of a jury,” Eustace de St. Phalle, a partner at Rains Lucia Stern, said in an interview. “He was always listening and was a great strategist.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Mr. Wallach’s legal reputation grew, he cultivated an air of eccentricity: He became known as “e. bob” — spelling his name without capital letters — and often went out in public with an exotic Saluki dog. He wore a yellow rose in his lapel.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He was married two times, to Barbara Wallach and later to Glenda Jones. Survivors include three daughters from his first marriage and seven grandchildren.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After returning to San Francisco, Mr. Wallach represented the Fang family as it purchased the San Francisco Examiner newspaper in 2000 from the Hearst company. He was also the longtime corporate counsel of the Sharper Image retail firm.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach taught at several Bay Area law schools and was an informal mentor to countless lawyers. He joined Rains Lucia Stern in 2016 and continued to practice law through 2019. According to the firm, he tried 283 cases that reached a verdict — and lost only 14 times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The only thing I’m guilt-ridden about,” Mr. Wallach said in 1993, “is my stupidity and poor judgment in venturing off into the minefields of Washington.”</p>"

How close was the Justice Department — specifically a high-ranking Trump ally, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-justice-department-overturn-election/2021/01/22/b7f0b9fa-5d1c-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>Jeffrey Clark</a> — to publicly saying that it was concerned about election fraud claims in battleground states such as Georgia?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Such a statement would have lent weight to Trump and his allies’ baseless claims even though they been thrown out in courts across the country, including by Trump-appointed and other Republican judges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also seeks to shed light on the actions of officials such as then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who played a major role in putting people who had plans to overturn the election results in front of the president, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/09/inside-mark-meadowss-final-push-keep-trump-power/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31'>reports The Post’s Michael Kranish.</a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But in the government, there were also strong pockets of resistance to Trump and his allies. Justice Department officials <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/durbin-report-trump-pressure-justice/2021/10/07/b51712d4-2769-11ec-8d53-67cfb452aa60_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_32'>threatened mass resignations</a> if Trump put Clark in charge of the Justice Department. (Trump never did install Clark in the top job.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also will delve into efforts to put forward alternate slates of electors who would vote for Trump. Republican officials in at least five states falsely declared that Trump won and that  the alternates were the true electors for their states; the Justice Department is <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/politics/fake-trump-electoral-certificates-justice-department/index.html?utm_campaign=wp_the_5_minute_fix&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_fix' target='_blank'>reviewing what happened.</a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee is particularly interested in unraveling the origins of this mass radicalization, which manifested in the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812 — this time, led by ordinary Americans rather than foreign soldiers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Washington Post’s Jacqueline Alemany, Josh Dawsey and Amy Gardner <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/04/jan-6-committee-set-make-its-case-public-with-prime-time-hearing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39' target='_blank'>report </a>that the committee plans to spend a significant amount of time on this topic: The panel wants to flesh out for the public what extremists and extremist threats look like, and how <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/21/oversight-trump-disinformation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39' target='_blank'>disinformation </a>spreads. It’s<b> </b>also focused on how right-wing groups got involved in the attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The government  in January charged the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, and 10 others with seditious conspiracy, a rare charge alleging they conspired to overthrow the government. And this week, seditious conspiracy indictments were handed down against Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, the former longtime chairman of the Proud Boys, and four of his top lieutenants.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the committee is also up against a wider cultural tolerance, within the Republican Party, of what happened on Jan. 6 and of attempts to undermine the 2020 election. Top Republican lawmakers — even former vice president Mike Pence, whose life was threatened by the attackers — have downplayed what happened. It’s now <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/23/us/jan-6-attendees.html'>a badge of honor in some circles</a> to have been in D.C. protesting election results or to be labeled an insurrectionist, even as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/24/madison-cawthorn-insurrectionist-challenge/?itid=lk_inline_manual_42'>the courts debate</a> whether people who participated can run for office. Republicans in Pennsylvania just nominated<a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/18/doug-mastriano-republican-pennsylvania/?itid=lk_inline_manual_42'> Doug Mastriano</a>, an election denier who passed through police barricades at the Capitol on Jan. 6, for governor. (He has said he did not enter the building and left when he realized the protest had turned violent.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Congress was convening that day to certify each state’s electoral votes, Trump took to a stage down the street from the Capitol and told his supporters: “I said something is wrong here, something is really wrong, can’t have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore,” <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/annotated-trump-speech-jan-6-capitol/?itid=lk_inline_manual_44' target='_blank'>he declared</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He had spent months before that falsely claiming in apocalyptic, sometimes violent language that the election was stolen from him. (“Be there, be wild,” he had tweeted, inviting his supporters to Washington for a “Stop the Steal” rally taking place just before<b> </b>the final step in the presidential certification process.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Much of the Republican Party apparatus geared up to support his election fraud claims. A majority of House Republicans signed onto a baseless, last-ditch lawsuit led by Republican state attorneys general asking the Supreme Court to step in and overturn the results in swing states Trump lost. Republican lawyers took election fraud claims to courts across the country — and often <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/23/why-trump-campaigns-big-legal-flameout-pennsylvania-seems-like-turning-point-even-republicans/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48' target='_blank'>got laughed out of court</a>. Conservative Republican senators announced they would reject certain states’ results on the 6th; one of them,  Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), was photographed giving Trump supporters a fist pump the day of the attack. Two local Republican election officials in Michigan originally voted to reject Detroit’s election results before changing their minds after an outcry from voters there. The Republican National Committee cheered on much of this.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The question the committee must answer is: How is all this connected to the attack? Was the insurrection a spontaneous outburst led by some bad actors in the crowd? Or is there evidence the violence was fed — or even coordinated — by government officials and the president himself, after months laying the groundwork for it?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Capitol is one of the most open complexes in Washington. But Capitol police had upped their security measures ahead of Jan. 6, aware that Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally down the street  near the White House could get out of hand. </p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So how did those protesters march up to the Capitol, overwhelm police, knock down barricades, and take over the House and Senate floors for a time, as well as top lawmakers’ offices? Five people died in the Jan. 6 attack or in the immediate aftermath, and 140 police officers were assaulted. The Capitol Police chief resigned a day after the insurrection.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the committee has debated how much to delve into that question, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/inside-jan-6-committee-key-questions-remain-hearings-loom/?itid=lk_inline_manual_56'>report The Post’s Jacqueline Alemany and Josh Dawsey</a>. Should the focus be on the building or the people who invaded it? “The Capitol didn’t attack itself,” a spokesman for Cheney  told them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Another aspect of this question is how the military responded. It took about three hours for members of the National Guard to respond, despite the Capitol Police begging for backup.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Congressional investigators have interviewed top Defense Department officials to try to put together a timeline of how and when the military responded to the attack. They also want to know whether Trump loyalists in the  department worked to activate martial law during the attack, an idea that was brought to Trump’s attention before and after the attack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/review-says-pentagon-reacted-appropriately-jan-6-riot-n1284074'>An independent review</a> within the Defense Department found that military leaders responded appropriately.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee also wants to share policy prescriptions to keep this from ever happening again.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One idea members seem to be coalescing around is reforming the Electoral Count Act, a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/05/eca-jan-6/?itid=lk_inline_manual_62'>law</a> dating  to the 1880s that governs how Congress approves states’ electoral votes. Lawmakers want to make it much harder for members of Congress to challenge states’ results and make it crystal clear that the vice president, who presides over the process, can’t override the will of voters while counting the votes.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But states, not Congress, control elections. So Congress has limited power to prevent state lawmakers or secretaries of state from overriding the popular vote. Before Trump set his sights on stopping the certification of the vote in Congress, he was pressuring state officials to overturn results in <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/election-overturn-plans/?itid=lk_inline_manual_63' target='_blank'>Georgia and Michigan</a>, among others.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The committee has also been looking at how Trump may have abused or considered abusing emergency power laws. These laws could have allowed the military to seize voting machines and require a rerun of the election. Trump also could have declared martial law,  imposing curfews and essentially extending his leadership indefinitely.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There’s no proof Trump considered declaring martial law.

In the 2019 fiscal year, when Hunter Biden purchased his gun, federal prosecutors received 478 referrals for lying on Form 4473 — and filed just 298 cases, according to data extracted from the U.S. attorneys’ case management system. That’s out of approximately 27 million background checks undertaken <a href='https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view' target='_blank'>in a 12-month period</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The numbers were roughly similar for fiscal 2018 (444 referrals and 271 cases) and fiscal 2020 (433 referrals and 243 cases).

While everyone “thought I was safe and sound at the center, I sat in my room and smoked the crack I’d tucked away in my traveling bag,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>About two weeks after the purchase of the gun, Biden’s then-girlfriend, Hallie, his brother’s widow, threw the .38 revolver into a trash can behind a grocery store across the street from a high school. “I think she believes I was gonna kill myself,” Biden told police, <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/25/sources-secret-service-inserted-itself-into-case-of-hunter-bidens-gun-477879' target='_blank'>according to the police report obtained by Politico</a>. The gun went missing but was later recovered and no charges were filed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>An attorney for Hunter Biden did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The data released by the Justice Department does not show how many people might have been prosecuted for falsely answering the question about active drug use. But <a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22015887-glenn-kessler-1604-resp-docs' target='_blank'>a review of such cases in Delaware</a>, also provided to The Fact Checker, shows that in fiscal 2019, only three Form 4473 cases were referred for prosecution in the state — and the U.S. attorney opted not to bring them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Many of the prosecutions concerned obvious instances of “straw buyers,” such as a woman purchasing a gun while on the phone with a friend receiving instructions about what type of gun to buy. Straw buyers are often acting on behalf of people who would not pass a background check, such as a felon. Keeping guns out of the hands of people who already have committed heinous crimes is probably a higher priority than a drug abuser.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The names in the referrals were redacted for privacy reasons, but a Justice Department official said none of the referrals mentioned Hunter Biden.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A <a href='https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipotfipf-fs.pdf' target='_blank'>1990 Justice Department feasibility study</a> noted how difficult it was to bring cases against people who falsely answer questions on Form 4473. Unlike the rich paper trail that exists for felons, no such record exists for drug abusers, the study said, noting that it is against the law to disclose “the medical records of persons who have been engaged in a drug rehabilitation program funded by the federal government.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Erik Longnecker, an ATF spokesman, said only that “the tweet is accurate.” He referred questions about the pace of prosecutions to the Justice Department.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a statement to The Fact Checker, another Justice Department official indicated that the Form 4473 cases were determined not to have enough evidence for a successful prosecution.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Declinations of matters referred to a U.S. attorney’s office can occur for a variety of reasons,” the statement said. “Initial declinations typically occur when the prosecutor makes an immediate determination that a matter is not sufficient or suitable for prosecution. The large majority of ‘later declinations’ — declinations where a USAO has delved into the facts and circumstances of the matter — show that suspects investigated [under false-statement statues] were declined for federal prosecution due to a lack of sufficient evidence in the matter referred.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>(<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48'>About our rating scale</a>)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Send us facts to check by filling out </b><a href='https://hosted-washpost.submissionplatform.com/sub/hosted/5c911f64439aa20034c4f0b7'><b>this form</b></a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Sign up for The Fact Checker </b><a href='http://wapo.st/1OGIZWF'><b>weekly newsletter</b></a></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>The Fact Checker is a verified </b><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/#code?itid=lk_inline_manual_51'><b>signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles</b></a></p>"

Michael Guest is fighting to keep his seat partly because he voted to establish a congressional committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, another sign that incumbents who don’t take the hard line position that the 2020 election was invalid could find themselves struggling to survive primary elections.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Guest, who is running for his third term, faced a primary challenge from Michael Cassidy, a former Navy pilot, who centered his campaign around the notion that Guest was not conservative enough for deep-red Mississippi. Cassidy narrowly beat Guest in Tuesday’s primary, but neither received more than 50 percent of the vote, forcing them into a head-to-head runoff on June 28.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Cassidy is among several Republicans prevailing in primary elections this year who have continued to spread false claims that the 2020 election results were stolen from former president Donald Trump. In Ohio, J.R. Majewski, who attended the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally and who has ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory, beat out three Republicans in a congressional primary. In Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano, who also attended the rally of election deniers on the National Mall, won the state’s gubernatorial primary.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Guest was among the 147 Republicans who, after the Jan. 6 attack, voted against certifying President Biden’s victory. A month later he signed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit challenging the 2020 results. Most recently, he co-sponsored the “Women’s Bill of Rights” resolution to define “sex” as a person’s biological sex — an attempt to weaken rights for transgender women — which he said is needed as “the radical left continues to push a woke ideology on women.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But to Cassidy, Guest’s decision to join 34 other House Republicans to set up a special commission to review the activities surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol attack was an unforgivable act of disloyalty.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Neither Cassidy nor Guest immediately responded to requests for comment on their race.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a local news interview a week ago, Cassidy attacked Guest over his support for the Jan. 6 committee, which begins its public hearings on Thursday. “It is the capstone of the democratic witch hunt of Trump and the republican party. The media and the democrats worked in cahoots with each other, so blinded by hatred of Trump,” he told <a href='https://www.columbianprogress.com/local-content-politics-state/getting-know-3-republican-primary-candidates-michael-cassidy#sthash.uqq5BWZO.dpbs' target='_blank'>the Columbian-Progress</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon interviewed Cassidy on Wednesday for his War Room show, a popular platform for the Make America Great Again movement. Candidates who appear on Bannon’s show are Trump devotees and believe the 2020 election was stolen from him. In exchange for that fealty, Bannon introduces them to his millions of radio listeners, which also can translate to new donors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“That Mr. Guest voted for the Jan. 6 commission, when people found out about that, they were furious if they didn’t know about it already. And so it was actually somewhat easy pickings once you tell people about your congressman,” Cassidy told Bannon. “He continues to defend that vote to this day … he hasn’t said anything about the political prisoners being held for being up on the Capitol that day.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump has endorsed dozens of candidates at every level of government this year, but Cassidy did not receive the former president’s coveted support ahead of the primary.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Congressional hopefuls aren’t the only candidates who are winning Republican primaries around the country. Republican voters in two states so far have chosen secretary of state candidates who embrace the lies about the election being stolen.

Then on June 3 the word was mentioned once, with reporter Griff Jenkins telling anchor Bret Baier that “the largest caravan ever to depart Tapachula” was expected to leave that Mexican city Monday — that is, June 6 — headed for the United States.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The network was <a href='https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=caravan&amp;ts=1w&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1' target='_blank'>off to the races</a>. “Caravan” came up seven times Saturday, 26 times Sunday and 58 times Monday. Another wave of Fox News migrant-caravan coverage had begun.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>We’ve been through this before. On at least four previous occasions, Fox News has amped up coverage of groups of migrants gathering in Mexico or Central America to travel to the United States. And on at least three of those four prior occasions, the trigger was more obviously politics than policy.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is the case that in recent years groups of migrants have gathered to make the trip to the U.S. border as a group. In part, that’s <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/24/migrant-caravan-updates/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7' target='_blank'>a function of safety</a>; it’s harder for drug cartels and other criminals to prey on migrants traveling in a large group than it is to pick off isolated travelers. But that grouping also offers Fox News a visual image it finds hard to resist: large numbers of migrants headed to the United States. Marching along like an invading force. Never mind that the caravan identified by Jenkins — the largest ever, he said — is made up of 11,000 people. That’s less than 5 percent of the number of people stopped at the border in April.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So have Fox News’s past amplification of migrant caravans actually correlated to surges in migration? Well, considering the number of people of stopped at the border: no. They have, however often correlated to elections and policy proposals.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Let’s consider five such spikes, including the most recent. They’re labeled below.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 1. </b>The first spike in Fox News’s mentions of migrant caravans in the past five years came in April 2018. That was the same month that Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href='https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-announces-zero-tolerance-policy-criminal-illegal-entry' target='_blank'>announced</a> a “zero tolerance” policy for migration, a policy that led to President Donald Trump’s infamous <a href='https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-discussing-immigration-enforcement-actions' target='_blank'>family separation policy</a> that May.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In March 2018, 50,347 migrants were apprehended at the border. In April, 51,168 were. In May, the number increased only slightly to 51,862. The caravan had no discernible effect on migration, though coverage of it would certainly help Sessions’s assertion that the “situation at our Southwest Border is unacceptable.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 2. </b>The next spike came a few months later, peaking in October 2018. This was the first Fox News-led caravan coverage that spurred broader national interest, in part thanks to the proximity of the 2018 midterm elections. (You can see that measured in Google searches for the term.) Two percent of Fox News’s 15-second segments that month mentioned the word “caravan.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This coverage was slow to fade out, only really ending by March 2019. Why? Perhaps in part because Trump had decided to fight Congress over funding for a wall on the border, eventually spurring the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. In February 2019, Trump announced a national emergency at the border that allowed him to divert funds from the Defense Department to build that wall (and thereby to fulfill a long-standing campaign pledge).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>From October 2018 to January 2019, an average of 60,590 migrants were apprehended at the border each month, ranging from 58,000 to 62,000. Only after the coverage of the caravan faded that spring (and after Trump announced the emergency) did apprehensions begin to climb.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 3.</b> Shortly after President Biden took office, Fox News again turned to coverage of migrant caravans. In January 2021, the network saw an increase in discussion of caravans. There was an increase in apprehensions both that month and in February 2021, though they began to surge significantly only in March.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 4.</b> The next spike came in October 2021, as Fox News was spending a great deal of time covering gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. You’ll notice that in the months leading up to last October, the number of apprehensions actually declined substantially, from 210,000 in August to 165,000 that month. There was an increase in November, of about 10,000 more apprehensions.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><b>Caravan 5. </b>That brings us to the current surge. It makes up a larger percentage of Fox News’s coverage in part because the month is young. By the end of the month, the percentage will probably have declined. It is still noticeable.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What’s the possible political trigger? Well, Jenkins’s report last week was centered on Biden’s effort to end a policy called Title 42 that allowed for quick deportation of apprehended migrants because due to the pandemic. Republicans have warned that ending Title 42 would increase the number of migrants coming to this country, something that the administration has been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/29/border-pandemic-title-42-immigration/?itid=lk_inline_manual_27' target='_blank'>working to prepare for</a>. Jenkins’s report centered on the large number of migrants waiting for that policy to be lifted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So, once again, caravans are asked by Fox News to do the legwork of representing a perceived invasion of foreigners at the border — despite years of not significantly affecting migration data at all.</p>"

Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote separately agreeing with the judgment.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In dissent, the court’s three liberal justices said they would have allowed the Washington state man’s lawsuit to proceed against the federal agent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the court had “absolutely immunized from liability” thousands of Border Patrol agents “no matter how egregious the misconduct or resultant injury.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Such cases “play a critical role in deterring unconstitutional conduct by federal law enforcement officers,” wrote Sotomayor, who was joined by Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The case was brought in 2017 by Robert Boule, who owned the Smuggler’s Inn, a <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/smuggler-s-inn-the-border-town-bed-and-breakfast-whose-visitors-don-t-always-stay-the-night-1.4082384' target='_blank'>bed-and-breakfast</a> located in Washington state along the Canadian border. Boule had a complicated relationship with federal agents, according to the court’s opinion. He sometimes served as a paid, confidential informant, helping agents identify people crossing the border illegally near his property. He also provided lodging and shuttle service to those crossing illegally, driving a black SUV with the license plate “SMUGLER.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Agents had seized from the inn shipments of illegal drugs, the opinion states, and Boule was recently convicted in Canadian court on human trafficking charges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Boule sued a Border Patrol agent whom he accused of unlawfully entering his property, and shoving and pushing him to the ground during a 2014 encounter involving a guest of Boule’s from Turkey. The agent, Erik Egbert, checked the guest’s immigration papers, which were up-to-date, and the guest unlawfully crossed the border into Canada that evening, the court’s opinion states. Boule alleged that the agent violated his constitutional rights by using excessive force and retaliating against Boule for complaining to the agent’s superiors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Central to the case is a 1971 ruling in <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics </i>in which the Supreme Court recognized that federal officers can be sued in some instances, even if such lawsuits had not been explicitly authorized by Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But since then, the court has moved to restrict when individuals can bring such federal lawsuits. Two years ago, a divided court ruled that the family of a Mexican teenager killed by a Border Patrol agent in a cross-border shooting could not sue in U.S. courts. Before that, the court said in 2017 that senior U.S. government officials cannot be held liable for the alleged unconstitutional treatment of noncitizens detained after 9/11.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the majority on Wednesday had rewritten and stretched its own legal standard “beyond recognition” to “close the door to Boule’s claim.” The conduct at issue, she noted, took place on U.S. soil and the injury was to a U.S. citizen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This case does not remotely implicate national security,” she wrote, adding that “Congress has not provided that federal law enforcement officers may enter private property near a border at any time or for any purpose.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But Thomas said the reasoning in earlier decisions involving national security applies to Boule’s case because the Border Patrol agent was carrying out his duty to stop people from illegally entering or leaving the United States. Boule, he said, had other ways to address his concerns about the agent’s conduct and noted that he had filed a complaint that led to a year-long internal investigation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The majority stopped short of overruling <i>Bivens</i>, but Gorsuch wrote separately to emphasize that the court should not leave the false impression that future claims will be viable.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Weighing the costs and benefits of new laws is the bread and butter of legislative committees. It has no place in federal courts charged with deciding cases and controversies under existing law,” he wrote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The court’s decision reverses a unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Egbert’s lawyer argued that allowing Boule’s claims would undermine the ability of Border Patrol agents to engage in searches as part of their immigration-enforcement responsibilities. The Biden administration backed the agent’s position.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Steven A. Engel, an attorney who filed a brief in support of Egbert on behalf of former U.S. attorneys general from Republican administrations, said the court got it right.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The plaintiff here could not point to any federal statute authorizing his suit, and the Court thus properly reaffirmed the constitutional principle that the power to create such legal remedies rests with Congress,” Engel said in an email Wednesday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Boule’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Does he actually believe any of the myriad other claims that had been fact-checked within weeks of that announcement? The <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3' target='_blank'>tens of thousands of things</a> that would be fact-checked by the time he left office? Or did he simply pretend to believe them? Was the truth in the middle, that he sort of believed them or convinced himself of them because it was useful to do so?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This has usually been an academic exercise, an exploration of Trump’s psychology. But in the wake of the attack at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the exercise became more concrete.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House select committee investigating that attack <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/understanding-criminal-allegation-jan-6-committee-is-constructing-against-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7'>believes</a> Trump committed crimes in the wake of his 2020 election loss. One is obstruction of an official proceeding, working to block the counting of electoral votes that day. Another is conspiracy to defraud the United States, centered on his having tried to obstruct “lawful governmental functions.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In each case, though, there’s a legal box to check. Trump must be shown to have tried to disrupt the transition of power to Joe Biden <i>corruptly</i>; that is, that he did so knowing he had no right to do so. There’s a difference between breaking the window of a jewelry store to steal diamonds and breaking the window to help put out a fire.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump says there was a fire. Those who had been closest to him for the past seven years, we are increasingly learning, assured him there wasn’t. So instead of declining to break the window, Trump replaced his most loyal people with others who insisted that the jewelry store was at immediate risk of burning down.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The most recently emergent example is Jared Kushner. In <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-jan-6.html' target='_blank'>a new report</a> for the New York Times, Peter Baker describes how Trump’s son-in-law decided against standing by the former president as he amplified false claims about the election being stolen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“No matter how vociferously Mr. Trump claimed otherwise, neither Mr. Kushner nor Ivanka Trump believed then or later that the election had been stolen, according to people close to them,” Baker writes. “While the president spent the hours and days after the polls closed complaining about imagined fraud in battleground states and plotting a strategy to hold on to power, his daughter and son-in-law were already washing their hands of the Trump presidency.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is by now a well-established feature of the Kushner-Ivanka public-relations system that people close to them will offer reporters a flawlessly complimentary portrait of the couple. But it is true that Kushner was not a common presence in the administration in the wake of the 2020 election loss. In fact, Baker reports, Kushner explicitly told Trump that he would not aid Trump’s effort to contest the election if former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was involved. Giuliani, not Kushner, then became the central face of the fight.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What Baker doesn’t establish is that either Kushner or Ivanka Trump told the president that the election hadn’t been stolen.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“One of the most striking realizations that emerged … was how many people around Mr. Trump did not believe the election had been stolen but kept quiet or checked out,” Baker writes, pointing to longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks as one of those who challenged Trump’s claims. But there’s a difference between not helping Trump break the window and actively telling him he’s wrong about the fire. Kushner, it seems, only did the former.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In her new memoir, former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/kellyanne-conway-admits-trump-lost-quite-usefully-her/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>claims</a> that she told Trump he’d lost, a claim Trump denied.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I may have been the first person Donald Trump trusted in his inner circle who told him that he had come up short this time,” she wrote — though by that point she was already outside the actual inner circle, having left the administration before the election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At another point in her book, Conway implicitly agrees with Baker’s framing of the post-election White House.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“For a president who many thought surrounded himself with yes-men, that was never the case until 2020,” she wrote. “And it proved costly from November to January.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This is somewhat self-serving for Conway as she seeks to distance herself from what happened after Trump lost. But it’s also clearly true. People like Sidney Powell and John Eastman didn’t have roles in the administration before the election. After the election, though, they had Trump’s ear because he liked what they had to say.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Eastman offers a specific example of why this question of what Trump believed is important. He was the attorney who <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/01/what-did-john-eastman-really-want-have-happen/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>argued in favor</a> of having Mike Pence simply reject submitted electoral votes on Jan. 6 itself. His communications with Trump have become a subject of legal jousting, as he tries to keep them private under the aegis of attorney-client privilege and as the Jan. 6 committee argues that attorney-client privilege doesn’t exist when the discussions center on the commission of a crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In March, Eastman’s attorney <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/us/politics/jan-6-panel-trump-fraud.html' target='_blank'>told the Times</a> that there was no corrupt intent in his arguments about the election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Dr. Eastman and others absolutely believed that what they were doing was well-grounded in law and fact,” he said, “and was necessary for what they believed was the best interest of the country.” In <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/trump-lawyer-eastman-fraud-evidence/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32' target='_blank'>a court filing</a>, the same argument is made in slightly different language: “Countless examples of election illegality and fraud, and expert opinion indicating a high likelihood of fraud, were available to President Trump and Dr. Eastman at the time.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>See, they thought there was a fire!</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This argument, though, is hard to defend. Yes, there were people around Trump telling him that there were “countless examples” of fraud, but those examples were all quickly dispatched as unimportant or incorrect. There were other people telling him something else, of course, including his loyal-until-almost-the-end attorney general William P. Barr and (according to a committee filing) <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/understanding-criminal-allegation-jan-6-committee-is-constructing-against-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_34' target='_blank'>staff from Trump’s campaign</a>. Had Trump listened to the people he’d been listening to up until Nov. 3, 2020, he’d have heard something very different from what Eastman and Giuliani and Powell were saying in the weeks after. Which, of course, is why he didn’t listen to them or why (as with Kushner) they didn’t speak up.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There’s also reason to be skeptical that Trump and Eastman were sincere in their consideration of alleged fraud. In an email with a Pennsylvania legislator, Eastman recommended <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/11/john-eastmans-pennsylvania-gambit-was-even-weaker-than-it-might-seem/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37' target='_blank'>inventing numbers</a> that would rationalize the legislature’s submitting an alternate slate of electors. This is not an example of something “well-grounded in law and fact.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump himself famously <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_38' target='_blank'>told</a> Georgia’s secretary of state that he “just want[ed] to find 11,780 votes” in the state, one more than needed to declare victory. Didn’t matter how, didn’t matter why, didn’t matter what the facts said. He simply wanted the votes — just enough votes — to be found.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Jared Kushner came to the White House as one of Trump’s most trusted allies. Literal family. He worked to keep Trump within the desired bounds. But at the end, Trump was apparently asked to choose between listening to his adviser-slash-son-in-law or to Giuliani, who was telling him the things he wanted to hear.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Trump decided to ally himself with those who were willing to indulge his fantasy. That will make it much harder for him to argue that he was simply acting in good faith.</p>"

So keep checking back for updates. But here are some early takeaways from the races we know about so far.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s become apparent that voters even in blue cities are willing to punish Democrats who are perceived as too soft on crime. Tuesday resulted in some particularly pronounced examples of that trend.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In San Francisco, voters made the historic decision to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/primaries-june-7-california-new-jersey/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8'>recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin</a>, who won office in 2019 while running on the idea of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/06/cehsa-boudin-recall/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8'>a less punitive criminal justice system</a>, including ending cash bail and sending fewer people to prison. The latest results show voters recalling him by a strong margin, 60 percent to 40 percent, with an estimated 61 percent of votes counted.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In Los Angeles, Rick Caruso and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who was once considered a contender to be President Biden’s vice president, look to be headed for a runoff in the mayor’s race. But Caruso, a former longtime Republican who made fighting crime the centerpiece of his campaign, led Bass by 42 to 37 percent early on.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The results come after voters <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/05/electoral-demise-defund-police/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11'>delivered similar verdicts in the 2021 elections</a>. In Minneapolis, Buffalo, Seattle and on Long Island in New York, they voted against candidates and measures related to the “defund the police” movement and ending cash bail. But Boudin might now be the chief example, given his policies and San Francisco’s reputation as one of the most liberal cities in the country.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>President Biden and other top Democrats have tried to steer their party away from “defund the police” and other related efforts, clearly worrying about the potential cost at the ballot box. And few in Congress have actually embraced that movement. But the local level has often been another matter, and Tuesday provided the latest warning sign about the potency of this issue.</p><div data-qa='article-video' class=''><div><div data-testid='video-wrapper'></div></div></div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Later this week, the House Jan. 6 committee will begin <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/06/january-6-committee-hearing-schedule-how-to-watch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>holding public hearings on the Capitol insurrection</a>. And on Tuesday, lawmakers’ previous votes on a 9/11-style bipartisan Jan. 6 commission suddenly became a flash point.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), who was one of <a href='https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021154' target='_blank'>35 House Republicans to vote for the commission</a>, found himself unexpectedly fighting for his political life, in a result few saw coming. Guest and Michael Cassidy are now headed for a runoff, with neither getting a majority of the vote.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Another House Republican who voted for the commission was Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.). He wound up surviving his primary against state Rep. Taffy Howard but was taking only about 59 percent of the vote — less than other statewide South Dakota GOP officials facing primaries. Howard has attacked Johnson for being too bipartisan, including by declining to sign on to then-President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As the Johnson example shows, it’s difficult to say how much of these dynamics stemmed from that particular vote. Unlike votes to impeach Trump, votes for the Jan. 6 commission (which failed in the Senate before the House launched a less bipartisan select committee) have yet to register as a major issue. But that’s in part because there is overlap between that issue and others in which members crossed partisan lines (such as the impeachment votes).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Another of the commission’s supporters in the House GOP, Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.), lost his primary last month. But that was against a fellow incumbent, Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) who also targeted McKinley for the latter’s vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So we’ll have to keep an eye on that.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Guest wasn’t the only Mississippi Republican struggling.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Rep. Steven M. Palazzo is also headed for a runoff after trying to fend off a challenge stemming from his <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-ethics-office-says-theres-substantial-reason-to-believe-rep-steven-palazzo-misused-campaign-congressional-funds/2021/03/01/1227840c-7b00-11eb-85cd-9b7fa90c8873_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_30' target='_blank'>alleged misuse of funds</a>. He was at 32 percent, well shy of the majority needed to avoid a runoff, with 97 percent of the votes counted. That’s also a number that suggests an incumbent is likely to lose their runoff. (It appears his runoff opponent will be Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And in California, Reps. David G. Valadao (R) and Young Kim (R) were trying to finish first or second in their respective districts in the state’s top-two primary system.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Valadao was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment, but he escaped having to face a high-profile Trump-backed challenger. (His opponent, Chris Mathys, <a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Chris_Mathys' target='_blank'>lost GOP primaries in New Mexico in 2018 and 2020.</a>) Despite that, though, Valadao was taking 26 percent to Mathys’s 19 percent, with about one-third of the vote in. Whoever emerges will face Democrat Rudy Salas in a blue-leaning district.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kim was running in a substantially unfamiliar district after redistricting. So far, it looks like she’ll make the general election, taking 34 percent to Republican Greg Raths’s 24.5 percent, with more than half of the vote in.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Were more incumbents to fall, they would join four predecessors. McKinley and Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.) lost incumbent-vs.-incumbent matchups, while moderate Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) fell to a more liberal challenger in a substantially redrawn district, and Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) lost after a string of personal problems.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Virtually every primary night has allowed us to glean some clues about Trump’s hold over the GOP and status as a kingmaker — with <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/trump-endorse-thirty-percent/?itid=lk_inline_manual_38' target='_blank'>a decidedly mixed verdict</a> thus far.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tuesday’s primaries, by contrast, included few big tests. But there still were some notable results.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In New Jersey, Trump-aligned Republican Frank Pallotta pulled an upset against Nick De Gregorio. Democrats had attacked Pallotta for being too Trumpy, in a clear effort to elevate him. Though Trump had backed Pallotta in his failed 2020 bid for the same seat, he didn’t endorse him this time. But De Gregorio had the backing of the Bergen County GOP, a status which gives a candidate prominent ballot placement in New Jersey and almost always means they’ll win. (The winner faces Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer in a blue-leaning seat.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And in Montana, former Trump interior secretary Ryan Zinke was in a very tight race in his bid to return to Congress, leading former state senator Al Olszewski 41-40 with about 92 percent of expected votes in. Trump backed Zinke despite his resigning from the administration in 2018 <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/interior-secretary-zinke-resigns-amid-investigations/2018/12/15/481f9104-0077-11e9-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>amid ethics investigations</a>. Zinke was attacked from the right as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-ally-zinke-fights-claim-hes-too-liberal-for-montana/2022/05/26/2814d970-dcae-11ec-bc35-a91d0a94923b_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>supposedly being too liberal</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It looks like he’ll emerge, but it was another nail-biter for a Trump candidate.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In South Dakota, an <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/today-south-dakota-voters-decide-whether-make-medicaid-expansion-harder/?itid=lk_inline_manual_47' target='_blank'>attempted workaround</a> to thwart Medicaid expansion failed badly. Opponents of the expansion, which will be on the ballot in November, tried to get the state to adjust the threshold for it and similar ballot measures to 60 percent, rather than a simple majority. The practical impact of this proposed rule, which was on the primary ballot Tuesday, would’ve been a majority of voters deciding to prevent another majority from expanding Medicaid later this year.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the end, it came nowhere close to a majority: constitutional Amendment C was defeated 67-33 early Wednesday. The thrust of the effort was clear: Proponents of Medicaid expansion have succeeded in the face of GOP opposition even in red states by using ballot measures, but the measures only once exceeded 60 percent approval — in Idaho, in 2018.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If a majority votes in favor of expanding Medicaid in November, South Dakota will the 39th state to do so.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Come January, it appears New Jersey will be sending two Robert Menendezes (Bobs Menendez?) to Congress. That’s after the senator’s son, Robert Menendez Jr., easily won a primary in the 8th Congressional District.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s very common for family members to win the House seats previously held by their relatives. Far less common is two generations of one family serving in Congress simultaneously; the New York Times <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/nyregion/robert-menendez-jr-congress-albio-sires.html' target='_blank'>reported</a> this has happened only a handful of times. The last time appears to be when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) overlapped for two years with his father, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), a decade ago.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The younger Menendez, a lawyer and first-time candidate, will be a heavy favorite come November to take the House seat his father vacated to join the Senate in 2006.</p>"

Susie Lee (D-Nev.) wanted to make clear that she will defend law enforcement in Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I always open these up and say I do not want to defund the police, and in fact have voted multiple times to increase funding to police departments,” Lee, who is on a list of House Democrats seen as vulnerable in November, told a group that included representatives from the two local law enforcement associations, which recently endorsed her reelection campaign.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Lee’s pledge of support for law enforcement is being replicated across the country as Democratic lawmakers up and down the ballot scramble to assure voters that they’re not soft on crime. It’s a sea change from two years ago when, amid the height of racial justice protests, some leaders on the left began to rethink their approach to criminal justice.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Fears that Democrats are losing ground on crime were compounded by <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/primaries-june-7-california-new-jersey/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8' target='_blank'>Tuesday primary results</a>, which included the recall of San Francisco district attorney<b> </b>Chesa Boudin, whom voters saw as overly lenient toward criminals. In the Los Angeles mayor’s race, billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, a former Republican who ran as a Democrat and campaigned on a message of improving quality of life, was projected to go to a runoff with onetime favorite Rep. Karen Bass (D).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>President Biden echoed the concern Wednesday. “The voters sent a clear message last night: Both parties ought to step up and do something about crime, as well as gun violence,” Biden said ahead of his trip to Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He noted that the American Rescue Plan, the first major bill he signed into law, included billions of dollars for policing but complained that some places haven’t used the money. “It’s time the states and the localities spend the money they have to deal with crime, as well as retrain police officers, as well as provide for more community policing,” Biden said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Homicide rates in cities across the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/21/homicide-rates-have-soared-nationwide-mayors-see-chance-turnaround-2022/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13' target='_blank'>country have soared over the past two years</a>, with officials blaming a combination of pandemic-related changes to the criminal justice system and in some places new, more lenient policing policies.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In response, Democratic candidates across the country are showcasing a tougher approach on crime. In D.C., a liberal haven with primaries later this month, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser is running on her record of bolstering police in schools. “You have to have a mayor who’s willing to make tough calls and not just go along with trendy words of the day,” Bowser <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/16/dc-mayor-debate-crime-education-housing/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14' target='_blank'>said in a recent debate where another Democratic candidate also sought a tough-on-crime mantle</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans are poised to capitalize on concerns about rising violence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Crime is the sleeper issue of this cycle,” said Chris Hartline, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the main group backing Senate Republicans.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He said fear about rising crime dovetails with inflation, still the top issue for voters, because quality of life contributes to a general sense of unease about the direction of the country. “It stretches beyond city politics to an issue that could move voters statewide,” Hartline said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced Wednesday morning that it will put $52.3 million behind political ads to back GOP House candidates in key races. The ads will use messaging that blames Democrats for spikes in violent crime in addition to inflation and poor management of the southern border.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We’re going to relentlessly remind Americans they are worse off than a year and a half ago,” NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer said in a statement issued Wednesday announcing that “soaring violent crime” will be among the attacks against Democrats this fall.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In states where the field is settled, the issue is already seeping into general-election campaigns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In an attempt to gin up online donations for author J.D. Vance, the Republican running for an open Senate seat in Ohio, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) praised Vance as “tough on crime.” In <a href='https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1528755947400740864?s=20&amp;t=WMN9aLI9E-la5gIHhbOKiA' target='_blank'>a posting on social media</a> that links to a fundraising page, Cotton attacked Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee in the Ohio race, for supporting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/23/biden-george-floyd-police-reform/?itid=lk_inline_manual_25' target='_blank'>passed the House but has stalled in the Senate</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tom Persico, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he’s encouraging House Democrats to confront head-on concerns that Democrats want to defund the police. “Attack the charge, say what you’re for, and then you can move on,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Nationally, Americans give Republicans an advantage of 12 percentage points on handling crime, according to a <a href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21842070-2022-04-28-trend-for-release' target='_blank'>Washington Post-ABC News poll from April</a>. That’s a marked shift from last summer, when Americans were about evenly divided on which party is better positioned to contend with crime.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In recent weeks, Lee and other Democrats have co-sponsored bipartisan legislation with Republicans that would <a href='https://susielee.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-lee-announces-introduction-bipartisan-invest-protect-act-make-investments'>invest</a> in police departments to help recruit more officers and provide adequate resources to effectively train officers on safety, de-escalation and more. Other bills have also been proposed to incentivize national recruitment campaigns and reauthorize community policing grants to boost wages and increase police presence in rural towns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Front-line Democrats, those representing swing districts and most at risk of losing their seats, have spent the past month pushing leadership to hold votes on these bipartisan bills. Even if the effort faces little to no chance in the Senate, members and aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss negotiations, said the votes are worth taking so they can return to their districts and have evidence that proves a majority of Democrats support funding the police.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Republicans are particularly hopeful that the heightened concerns about crime can help them with suburban voters, where they’ve lost ground in recent elections.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Tuesday offered some evidence that they might be right. In New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, a suburban swath near New York City that the GOP views as a top target in November, law and order was top of mind.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Crime is the number one issue,” said Gerhard Otto, who is originally from South Africa and voted for the first time in a U.S. election Tuesday in Scotch Plains, N.J. “Things have gone backwards since I first visited in 2012,” Otto said after casting a ballot for Tom Kean Jr., who prevailed in the Republican primary.

Chesa Boudin (D) came into office in 2020 promising a different approach to fighting crime and, in a lopsided vote, San Franciscans rejected that approach. Even in liberal San Francisco, some leftist policies go too far.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But then there was the larger city to the south. In Los Angeles — even Democrat-heavy Los Angeles! — a former Republican was one of the top two finalists for mayor. In journalism they say that three makes a trend. When pressed, though, two will do, so: Democrats stumbling in their strongest state <a href='https://www.axios.com/2022/06/08/san-francisco-district-attorney-loses-recall' target='_blank'>portends horrors</a> for the party!</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Look, there’s certainly no sense in which these results are good news for the party.

It is true that both San Francisco and Los Angeles vote more heavily Democratic than the rest of the country. But the two are not equivalently blue. San Francisco has consistently voted much more heavily Democratic than has Los Angeles.

Cities overall have done so, as measured at the county level.

This question is largely distinct from the results on Tuesday.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>There’s another way in which San Francisco and Los Angeles diverge. The emergence of the information economy has caused incomes in San Francisco (and elsewhere in the Bay Area) to spike. The city is no longer the hippie, drifter wonderland it became famous for being.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This has an immediate practical effect: increased housing costs in particular have <a href='https://homelessness.ucsf.edu/blog/san-fransicko-incorrect-about-housing-affordability-and-homelessness' target='_blank'>contributed to homelessness</a>, a central part of discussions about how Boudin and the city’s leadership are failing. It’s not a stretch to assume that wealthier residents who have made substantial investments in property in the city are more wary about threats to property values. When Donald Trump announced he planned to focus on blue-state homelessness during his presidency, he <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/17/trump-reveals-motivation-his-anti-homelessness-push-foreign-real-estate-tenants/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>cited complaints</a> from real estate investors.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>So that’s the context, particularly important for considering Boudin. As district attorney, he was understandably accountable for the immediately tangible quality of life issues in the city like crime and homelessness. And crime did rise in the city in 2021 relative to 2020, though not exceptionally relative to other big cities. The number of crimes recorded in 2021 was also <a href='https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/San-Francisco-crime-Chesa-Boudin-London-Breed-16751930.php' target='_blank'>still lower</a> than in 2019.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In February, a member of the board of supervisors <a href='https://sfgov.org/policecommission/sites/default/files/Documents/PoliceCommission/PoliceCommission042022-SupervisorRonenletter%26Deptresponse.pdf' target='_blank'>noted</a> that the police department’s clearance rates had dropped — that is, the number of crimes solved — and linked that to the “political rift between the Police Department and District Attorney’s Office” which she worried was “causing a deliberate work stoppage by your Department.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Boudin’s was not the only successful recall in San Francisco in recent months. Earlier this year, a number of members of the school board were also recalled. As with the district attorney’s race, the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/11/trailer-san-franciscos-school-board-recalls-are-tearing-democrats-apart/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>situation was complicated</a>, a mix of frustration at leadership, pandemic-era changes and political opportunism. But there was one similarity between the two: recall supporters <a href='https://sfstandard.com/education/money-and-motives-school-board-recall/' target='_blank'>spent</a> far more money than opponents. In the Boudin recall, <a href='https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Groups-wanting-Chesa-Boudin-recalled-raise-more-17221264.php' target='_blank'>the gap</a> was more than 2 to 1 in support of recalling Boudin.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That was part of the story in Los Angeles, too. The former Republican who made the mayoral runoff, developer Rick Caruso, who switched his registration from “no party preference” to Democratic ahead of the primary, spent <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/self-funding-caruso-dominates-la-mayoral-ad-spending-rcna31622' target='_blank'>nearly $34 million</a> in that effort. Rep. Karen Bass, the second-place finisher who Caruso will face in November, spent a tenth of that amount.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Caruso’s success carries that asterisk that Boudin’s loss doesn’t. He made the runoff … but still has to win in a one-on-one contest. Los Angeles has nonpartisan elections, which may also have benefited Caruso’s candidacy. In November, both the larger electorate and Democrats coalescing around Bass may shift the order of finish. Boudin was likely similarly hurt by the nature of the election: low turnout overall, suggesting a more conservative electorate, with recall supporters more motivated to cast ballots.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These are all points of consolation for Democratic leaders on Wednesday morning, as will be Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handy defeat of a recall effort of his own last year. But they should not obscure from the broader problem. Democrats are in charge in Los Angeles and San Francisco and America broadly, given their control of the White House and Congress. And in all of those places, people have real concern about how things are going. One can point to extenuating circumstances or to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/pessimism-about-economy-is-about-both-partisanship-prices/?itid=ap_philipbump&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>subtleties of the data</a> or to the role of media in amplifying concerns. But the results in Los Angeles (Caruso made crime and homelessness a focus) and more directly in San Francisco reflect frustration with existing leadership that is likely largely independent of party.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The results in California on Tuesday may not portend a collapse of the Democratic Party over the long term. But they do reinforce the looming danger the party faces in November.</p>"

And they figure to feature prominently in the hearings that will be launched Thursday night by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>U.S. District Judge David O. Carter <a href='https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840.356.0.pdf' target='_blank'>ruled </a>that more of Trump lawyer John Eastman’s documents and emails must be turned over to the committee because they pertain to the probable crime and thus are not privileged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And in doing so, Carter offered a notable account of the plot. He said the “plan to disrupt the Joint Session” of Congress on Jan. 6 — the crime that he says probably was committed — “<a href='https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000181-4144-d2d5-abb1-f9c47cc00000' target='_blank'>was fully formed and actionable as early as December 7, 2020</a>.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The progression of the alleged plot remains somewhat shrouded, given that we don’t know all of what is contained in Eastman’s documents and that the revelation of the details has been piecemeal in media reports and in legal rulings such as Carter’s. But the alleged plot being “fully formed” as early as Dec. 7 would be significant.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The most detail we have comes from <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/15/another-lawyer-another-memo-offering-advice-stealing-presidency/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10' target='_blank'>Eastman’s memos</a> laying out ways on Jan. 6 to overturn the election. But the first of those memos reportedly was produced in late December. A Dec. 7 date would place the effort beginning significantly earlier. Indeed, it would have begun almost immediately after Eastman formally joined Trump’s legal team on Dec. 6. Formalizing that relationship carried benefits when it came to keeping certain communications and strategizing privileged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It would also suggest the plot might have predated efforts to create <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/07/significance-trumps-fake-electors-explained/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12' target='_blank'>alternative slates of so-called “fake electors”</a> for Trump on Dec. 14 that could be used to replace the official ones appointed for the electoral college and overturn the election. Carter also ordered Eastman to turn over documents related to efforts to meet with a group focused on what state legislatures could do to further the effort.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And, also important, as <a href='https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1534496183216898049' target='_blank'>Politico’s Kyle Cheney noted</a>, Vice President Mike Pence <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/30/pence-jan-6-legal-showdown-00021864' target='_blank'>on Dec. 7 asked for a briefing</a> from his legal counsel about his options when it came to certifying electoral college votes. Carter’s ruling would suggest that this requested briefing might have been a response to a “fully formed” plot emerging well before Jan. 6.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Carter doesn’t dwell upon precisely why he says the plot was “fully formed and actionable as early as December 7, 2020.” And that could be interpreted a number of ways. The evidence he cites is Eastman’s forwarding a memo that day that called Jan. 6 a “Hard Deadline” that was “critical to the result of this election.” He also refers to a Dec. 22 email in which a member of Trump’s legal team cites “the January 6 strategy,” which Carter interprets as meaning the eight recipients would have understood what that was.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But that doesn’t say precisely how much the strategy for Jan. 6 was fleshed out at that early date. It’s certainly something the Jan. 6 committee will be probing and providing detail on in the coming days and weeks.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The other key piece of Carter’s ruling that’s worth highlighting is an email on that same date — Dec. 22 — which is one of the emails he ruled Eastman must turn over. The judge says an unnamed lawyer actually argued <i>against </i>taking the Jan. 6 strategy to court, fearing an adverse ruling:</p><blockquote class='blockquote border-box black font--article-body pl-sm pl-md-ns bc-black b bl cb mb-md mt-sm-ns mb-lg-mod-ns'><div class='' data-qa='article-quote'>In the fifth email, dated December 22, 2020, an attorney goes beyond strategizing litigation outcomes. This email considers whether to bring a case that would decide the interpretation of the Electoral Count Act and potentially risk a court finding that the Act binds Vice President Pence. Because the attorney concluded that a negative court ruling would “tank the January 6 strategy,” he encouraged the legal team to avoid the courts. This email cemented the direction of the January 6 plan. The Trump legal team chose not to seek recourse in court — instead, they forged ahead with a political campaign to disrupt the electoral count.</div></blockquote><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This could be crucial. Certainly, the Trump campaign will have viewed the particular courts involved as being unfriendly to them. But, like previous evidence, including <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/heated-jan-6-email-exchange-between-trumps-pences-lawyers-annotated/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>Eastman’s discussions of disregarding the Electoral Count Act</a>, such an email could be read to show that the Trump campaign knew what it was doing might be illegal — or at least could be ruled as such by a court.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Carter summarized: “Lawyers are free not to bring cases; they are not free to evade judicial review to overturn a democratic election.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Expect all of this to be chewed over plenty in the coming days and weeks.</p>"
