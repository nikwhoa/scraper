After all, the typical U.S. family spends $2,060 on average per year for home utility bills, according to the most recent estimate <a href='https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-expert/breaking-down-the-typical-utility-bill' target='_blank'>published by EnergyStar.gov</a>. So Biden is promising big savings.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But it turns out the White House has been engaging in some inflation of its own.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>If that $500 figure appears familiar, it’s because you heard something similar in the president’s <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/' target='_blank'>State of the Union address</a> on March 1. He said his American Rescue Plan would “cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combating climate change.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That figure was a reference to <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf' target='_blank'>a report</a> published in October by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Rhodium predicted that if Biden’s climate change policies were adopted, <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=23' target='_blank'>by 2030</a> “national average annual household energy costs” would be “roughly $500 lower than under current policy.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>First of all, that’s eight years from now — not a lot of help with the current inflation problem, which was the frame of Biden’s op-ed. But the bigger problem is that “national average annual household energy costs” is not the same thing as household utility bills.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><a href='https://rhg.com/team/john-larsen/' target='_blank'>John Larsen</a>, a Rhodium partner and principal author of the report, said the estimate includes both home energy services and the cost of driving. The two elements are roughly equal in terms of energy costs of $4,163 — $2,126 for mobility and $2,037 for home energy. (Note that the home energy element is similar to the EnergyStar estimate.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But most of the estimated savings, Larsen said, comes from the driving side of the equation. “Of the $495 in savings, $403 comes from mobility savings (spending less money on gasoline either because of more efficient cars or electric vehicles) and the remainder is home energy savings,” he wrote in an email.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Indeed, the report <a href='https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rhodium-Group_Pathways-to-Paris-A-Policy-Assessment-of-the-2030-US-Climate-Target.pdf#page=24' target='_blank'>notes</a> that, if the Biden climate plan were adopted, home electricity bills by 2030 would be between one dollar more and five dollars less than under current policy. That might pay for an extra ice cream cone over the summer.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Larsen noted that Biden, in the op-ed, referred to learning this number in a conversation with utility executives, so he did not appear to be referencing the Rhodium report. “I can say that our numbers represent savings across all household energy expenditures and not just those associated with utility bills,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But when we located <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-roundtable-with-ceos-of-electric-utilities-to-discuss-his-build-back-better-agenda/' target='_blank'>the transcript</a> of Biden’s conversation with utility executives on Feb. 9, we found no reference to $500 in utility savings. The figure was also not mentioned in <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/readout-of-the-presidents-meeting-with-utility-ceos-who-support-the-climate-and-clean-energy-investments-in-build-back-better/' target='_blank'>the White House readout</a> of the meeting.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Somehow, as inflation became a hot political issue, the $500 figure that was cited in the State of the Union address appears to have morphed into a reference to utility bills.

Biden suggested he was not informed until April.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I don’t think anyone anticipated the impact of the shutdown of one facility,” Biden said after the meeting, adding, “Once we learned the extent of it and how broad it was, it kicked everything into gear.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But when reporters noted that the executives had said they immediately recognized the scope of the problem, Biden said, “They did, but I didn’t.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The disconnect between the industry’s alertness to the looming crisis and the administration’s lack of awareness was hinted at during the panel discussion itself.

But the declaration by industry leaders that the scope of the problem was immediately clear to them in February raises questions of why the president was slow to learn of the issue.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did not offer more details on the timeline, but she said the administration launched a “whole-of-government approach” shortly after the Abbott plant shut down. The Food and Drug Administration closed the Abbott plant in February after a federal inspection found samples of a dangerous bacteria.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“We have been doing this whole-of-government approach since the recall,” she said at the White House daily press briefing after Biden met with the executives. “We have been working on this for months, for months. We have been taking this incredibly seriously.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When pressed why Biden himself said he was unaware of the “whole-of-government approach,” Jean-Pierre said that Biden “has multiple issues, crises at the moment” and that administration officials often respond to problems before the president is aware.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Seeing the empty shelves is unacceptable,” she said. “Seeing what families are going through is unacceptable.

And for good reason. Donald Trump has made <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/16/politics/trump-secretary-of-state-big-lie/index.html' target='_blank'>a concerted effort to install loyalists and election deniers as secretaries of state</a> and in other high-ranking positions with election responsibilities in key states. And the overall tenor of such GOP primaries nationwide has <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/07/gop-candidates-election-claims/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2' target='_blank'>trended decidedly toward Trump’s baseless allegations of a “stolen election”</a> — despite the lessons of Jan. 6, 2021. When people who say they wouldn’t have certified President Biden’s 2020 win might be in a position to stop that come 2024, that matters a lot.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But it’s worth emphasizing and reemphasizing just how much these battles could truly be forged at the lowest levels of government — involving people and positions you’ve probably never heard of. These are the positions Republicans have long proved superior at mobilizing their side to focus on. And a new Politico report reinforces how an effort to sway future elections could spring from those positions.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/01/gop-contest-elections-tapes-00035758' target='_blank'>Heidi Przybyla writes</a>:</p><blockquote class='blockquote border-box black font--article-body pl-sm pl-md-ns bc-black b bl cb mb-md mt-sm-ns mb-lg-mod-ns'><div class='' data-qa='article-quote'>Video recordings of Republican Party operatives meeting with grass roots activists provide an inside look at a multipronged strategy to target and potentially overturn votes in Democratic precincts: Install trained recruits as regular poll workers and put them in direct contact with party attorneys.</div><div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'>The plan, as outlined by a Republican National Committee staffer in Michigan, includes utilizing rules designed to provide political balance among poll workers to install party-trained volunteers prepared to challenge voters at Democratic-majority polling places, developing a website to connect those workers to local lawyers and establishing a network of party-friendly district attorneys who could intervene to block vote counts at certain precincts.</div><div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'>“Being a poll worker, you just have so many more rights and things you can do to stop something than [as] a poll challenger,” said Matthew Seifried, the RNC’s election integrity director for Michigan, stressing the importance of obtaining official designations as poll workers in a meeting with GOP activists in Wayne County last Nov. 6. It is one of a series of recordings of GOP meetings between summer of 2021 and May of this year obtained by POLITICO.</div><div class='mt-md' data-qa='article-quote'>Backing up those front-line workers, “it’s going to be an army,” Seifried promised at an Oct. 5 training session. “We’re going to have more lawyers than we’ve ever recruited, because let’s be honest, that’s where it’s going to be fought, right?”</div></blockquote><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Indeed, that <i>is </i>where it’s largely going to be fought, at least initially.

The deniers are being elevated, while those who stand by the election results have repeatedly been censured.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Just as important, laws are being changed, despite no evidence calling the 2020 election results into question. As <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/14/how-republicans-seek-make-it-easier-challenge-even-overturn-election-results/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>we wrote late last year</a>, not only are secretaries of state being targeted for defeat by Trump allies, but two (Raffensperger and Katie Hobbs in Arizona) have been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/27/gops-brazen-move-strip-power-fraud-narrative-busting-secretary-state-again/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>stripped of election-related power</a>. Wisconsin Republicans are trying to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/27/trumps-gop-election-purge-marches-despite-setbacks-georgia/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>get rid of a bipartisan election commission</a> and put the process under more partisan control (and recently succeeded in pushing a critic of Trump’s fraud claims to resign). They’ve <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-national-divide/2021/09/05/24165092-0b4e-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_41&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_16' target='_blank'>increased the penalties</a> for supposed wrongdoing by election administrators. A report last week from a watchdog showed <a href='https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DCITM_2022.pdf' target='_blank'>14 states had passed laws </a>that would make it easier to challenge elections in various ways.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s possible to oversell the true danger of any of this. Some doubt, for instance, the impact that canvassers can have when it comes to not certifying a vote — given that such canvassers’ jobs are generally ministerial. Even poll workers who raise a fuss about mundane vote-counting issues could see their efforts rebuffed by the courts when push comes to shove, as they were in 2020. It’s possible the 2024 election won’t be close enough for any of this to matter, and that the fever in the GOP surrounding voter fraud could break if, for instance, Trump fades politically.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But one of the lessons of 2020 is that the few Republicans who clearly rebuked Trump’s claim were, not coincidentally, disproportionately those who were <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/08/gop-officials-overwhelmingly-side-against-trumps-voter-fraud-claims-when-forced-decide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>forced to actually take a position by virtue of their official duties</a>. Such people have since been weeded out, often through targeting in GOP primaries, but also through attrition (such as election workers <a href='https://apnews.com/article/election-officials-retire-trump-2020-threats-misinformation-3b810d8b3b3adee2ca409689788b863f' target='_blank'>heading for the exits because of threats</a>); in several cases Republicans have warmed to voter-fraud claims they <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/07/gop-candidates-election-claims/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>never endorsed back in 2020</a>. The pressure has been palpable, and it’s manifested itself in a number of ways that matter, irrespective of <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/25/georgia-texas-primaries-takeaways/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20' target='_blank'>Raffensperger somehow managing to win renomination</a> last week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The problem with telling that story — of how democracy could be undermined at the grass roots — is that it’s very difficult to get a handle on it in any truly authoritative and quantitative way; it depends so much on the views of people whose views have never been recorded, because nobody outside of a select few even know who they are.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But there is little doubt about what kinds of people will be drawn to these lower-level positions, because we’re seeing what kinds of people are being drawn into running for similar, higher-profile roles.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And the problem could go beyond poll workers raising legally valid complaints or canvassers and secretaries of state refusing to certify results. As we saw in 2020, the simple presence of enough smoke and misinformation was enough to get state and congressional Republicans to seriously consider overriding the vote totals in certain states. The effort to get GOP-run state legislatures to send alternate slates of electors and Congress to reject the results on Jan. 6 was haphazard and didn’t pan out, but we’re in a very different environment even than we were then.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And if enough election truthers are in place to color the process from the grass-roots level up — in a way they failed to in 2020 when the groundwork wasn’t yet laid — it’s not so difficult to see Republicans justifying decisions to themselves that they didn’t in 2020. Because if there’s one thing the Trump era has reinforced, it’s that these things often flow up from the bottom.</p>"

During the Trump administration, under Ennis’s watch, the program began levying unprecedented fines, which reached hundreds of thousands of dollars, on more than 100 people accused of improperly receiving disability benefits.

In Kansas, the state’s highest court has held that “natural rights” protect “personal autonomy,” including the right to abortion.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>For more than three decades in Florida, courts have interpreted a voter-backed privacy provision of the state constitution to include the right to abortion. The state Supreme Court in 1989 invalidated a law requiring minors to obtain parental consent to get an abortion based on the provision that states that every “person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into his private life.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The court’s ruling stated that it could “conceive of few more personal or private decisions concerning one’s body that one can make in the course of a lifetime.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Florida has some of the least restrictive abortion laws in the southeast. The state  has allowed<b> </b>abortion up to 24 weeks, the standard established by <i>Roe</i>, which protects access until a fetus is viable outside the womb.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The 15-week ban — passed by the Republican-controlled legislature in March and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in April — is modeled on the Mississippi law under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Florida law includes exceptions to save the life of the mother and for “fatal fetal abnormalities” but not for rape or incest. Clinics and health-care providers could face criminal penalties<b> </b>and disciplinary action for performing abortions after the 15-week mark.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>State Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, said the new law is at odds with the “Florida value around privacy, around personal medical decisions, including someone’s pregnancy. There’s an understanding that it is not a politician’s place to get involved,” said Eskamani, who began her career as an abortion rights advocate.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Despite Florida’s constitutional protections, the legal landscape in the state has changed as DeSantis has appointed new, more-conservative judges. In April, a lower court judge upheld the constitutionality of a 2015 law that requires a woman to wait 24 hours after consulting with a doctor before having an abortion.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I don’t think we can be naive about this,” Eskamani said.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In their filing Wednesday, lawyers for Florida abortion providers and abortion rights advocates urged the circuit court for Leon County to issue an injunction to prevent the 15-week ban from taking effect July 1.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Despite Florida’s history of protecting the right to abortion, the Florida legislature recently engaged in a brazen attempt to override the will of the Florida people,” the attorneys wrote in the 33-page filing. The legislature, they said, passed a law that will “unlawfully intrude upon the fundamental privacy rights of Florida women. It will deny Floridians’ autonomy over their own bodies and undermine their ability to make deeply personal decisions about their lives, families, and health care free of government interference.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In a statement Wednesday, the governor’s office said DeSantis is “confident that this law will ultimately withstand all legal challenges.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an antiabortion organization, characterizes to the state’s abortion protections as an “artificial superpowered abortion right,” more expansive than the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Roe </i>and subsequent decisions. If the constitutional challenge filed Wednesday makes its way to the state Supreme Court, he said the newly configured, seven-member court is likely to reexamine past decisions.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>State supreme courts “have the unique privilege of looking at the constitution with fresh eyes,” said Stemberger, who served on the judicial nominating commission for former Republican governor Jeb Bush. Florida’s high court, he added, “has already shown in the past year in multiple cases, its willingness to do this and to say, ‘The previous Supreme Court got it wrong.’”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At the U.S. Supreme Court in December, the conservative majority at oral argument appeared likely to uphold Mississippi’s 15-week ban. A <a href='https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-874f-dd36-a38c-c74f98520000' target='_blank'>draft majority opinion made public last month by Politico</a> showed that five justices had tentatively voted to overturn the right to abortion established in <i>Roe</i>. A final decision is expected before the term ends in late June or early July.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The outcome of the Mississippi case and the state case filed Wednesday will influence future legislative efforts in Florida to restrict abortion access, said state Sen. Kelli Stargel, the lead sponsor of the 15-week ban.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If all abortion decisions go back to the states, I would hate for our state to be seen as a place to have more opportunity for abortions than others,” said Stargel, a Republican from central Florida now running for an open congressional seat. “That’s disturbing to me. We are a pro-life state and we want to protect the unborn.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'><i>Caroline Kitchener contributed to this report.</i></p>"

More than enough to make a guy cranky.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But this is not just any guy. It’s Gregg Phillips, the guy who, in D’Souza’s film and at hearings in front of friendly state legislatures, has used intentionally pejorative language to cast his perceived opponents as criminals or dangerous. The people carrying ballots — which, if it occurred, wasn’t even illegal in two of the states True the Vote and D’Souza looked at — are “mules,” as in drug mules. The places where they allegedly collected these ballots (a part of the process left completely unproven in the film) become “stash houses.” All of it, he has declared, showed “organized crime.” It’s not subtle.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>During a hearing before legislators in Arizona on Tuesday, Phillips applied that same tactic to members of the media.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I think somebody wrote — the New York Times or someone — wrote, well, you can tell that they’re walking down the street, but you can’t see which side of the street they’re on,” he said. “Utter nonsense. It’s complete nonsense. They’re asking the wrong questions. They’re asking the wrong people.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“These articles are being written by journalistic terrorists,” he added.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Repeat that last line?” a legislator asked — drawing it out for emphasis, as she later made clear.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Yeah,” Phillips said. “The articles are being written by journalistic terrorists, of which I think are probably one or two in this room.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Kelli Ward, chair of the Republican Party in the state, liked that phrase.</p><div data-oembed-type='twitter' class='' style='min-height:171px'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>False Information being written and disseminated by “journalistic terrorists” like some of these👇🏼👇🏼 <a href='https://t.co/qTUxmfqQJc'>pic.twitter.com/qTUxmfqQJc</a></p>— Dr. Kelli Ward 🇺🇸 (@kelliwardaz) <a href='https://twitter.com/kelliwardaz/status/1531778377605976064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>May 31, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async='' src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script>\n</div><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In addition to retweeting Ward, the state party went further, <a href='https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/media/2022/05/31/arizona-republican-party-media-are-domestic-terrorists-tweet/7463139001/' target='_blank'>declaring</a> that the “mainstream media is Domestic Terrorists.” It later deleted that and another similar tweet.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What’s remarkable about Phillips’s comment isn’t simply how astonishingly over-the-top it was, or even how it made obvious his predilection for exaggerating nefariousness. What’s remarkable is that the new presentation did little to nothing to actually address the valid questions about his purported research. In fact, he made a comment that significantly <i>weakened</i> his case.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At issue is the reliability of his analysis of data collected from cellphones. The idea that thousands of people were ferrying ballots around battleground states depends on the regularity of those phones being in proximity to places with ballot drop boxes. Phillips and his supporters have regularly tried to suggest that people who doubt his analysis are casting doubt on the ability of phones to precisely geolocate someone, which is not the case. But it is the case that there’s good reason to think that Phillips’s analyses don’t include precise measurements of proximity to ballot drop boxes.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Consider what actually determining that someone visited a drop box would require. You’d need a precise measurement of location from the phone and you’d need to know precisely where the drop box was. In other words, you’d need to know that the phone was within a foot or two of a space that itself is only a few square feet. Not only will experts tell you that most cellphone geolocation data is not sufficiently precise, there’s no indication that the True the Vote people even knew where drop boxes were located at the libraries and government offices that hosted them.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The best indication we have of what True the Vote was looking at comes from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which in September <a href='https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1451309892824936452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1451309892824936452%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpb.org%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2Fgbi-says-gops-cellphone-data-lacks-enough-evidence-prove-ballot-harvesting' target='_blank'>determined</a> that the data it was provided was insufficient to launch an investigation. The GBI said that the data was “cell site location information” — a triangulated location estimate less accurate than GPS — and that it centered on identifying visits “within 100 feet of a voter drop box.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That’s significantly less precise than Phillips likes to suggest. During his testimony in Arizona, in fact, Phillips insisted that the military could get GPS precision down to a few centimeters. And <a href='https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/#difference' target='_blank'>that’s true</a> — using specific technology that’s not generally available commercially. Using technology that there’s no reason to think he had. Instead, he insisted that by overlapping different bits of data — WiFi access and Bluetooth — he could get more precise. That’s not what the GBI says it received.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>At one point, True the Vote’s team showed this map, purporting to show one person’s movements in Yuma County, Ariz.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“This is a sample pattern of life for one device in Yuma County from October 7th through November 3rd,” Phillips’s colleague Catherine Engelbrecht said. “This device went to 77 unique drop boxes. And you can see in the lower right where those locations were.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Beyond all of the other questions that naturally arise — like, why bother going to different drop boxes, particularly in less-populated areas? — the data appear to show cellphone pings of someone who lives in Yuma (at top center) and occasionally drives around the region. Do those blue dots correspond to clear visits to libraries? Or more accurately, to visits to drop boxes at those libraries? Not to mention that Yuma County’s 2020 voter guide doesn’t include locations like the Foothills Library (at 13226 S. Frontage Rd. in Yuma) on its <a href='https://www.yumacountyaz.gov/home/showdocument?id=41773' target='_blank'>list of drop-off locations</a>. We’re just meant to take Phillips’s and Engelbrecht’s word for it.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That’s what D’Souza did. I <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/17/discussing-gaps-2000-mules-with-dinesh-dsouza/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>spoke to him</a> about the movie and about Phillips’s data, repeatedly pressing him on questions about credibility. I asked him, for example, how he could be confident that people shown in the movie dropping off ballots were actually “mules,” given that there was no evidence provided for their having gone to more than one drop box. Considering one example of a guy on a bike dropping off a ballot, I pointed out to D’Souza that, beyond Phillips suggesting that the guy was being paid to deposit the ballot, the movie makes no direct claim and offers no evidence that he’s a “mule.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Of course there is a claim being made!” D’Souza insisted. “The context of the movie is to explain that that’s the search criterion. All the mules being counted under that rubric went to 10 or more drop boxes.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Fine. But in Arizona, Phillips made a different claim — to again disparage journalists.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“One of the fallacies in people evaluating and fact-checking the movie,” he said, “really centered around a couple of videos that were out there of people shoving a whole bunch of ballots in.” That would presumably include the guy on the bike, who Phillips claimed (though it’s not apparent in the video) pulls “ballots” out of his backpack.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“Interestingly, only one of those people actually was a mule,” he continued, “because they didn’t meet the standard of having to get inside 10 times and go to one of the [nonprofit organizations] five times.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>You got that? Fact checks <a href='https://www.ajc.com/politics/what-2000-mules-leaves-out-from-ballot-harvesting-claims/FFMNUU56RVBRNOLZKWHUREQPEU/' target='_blank'>pointing out</a> that the people included in the film “2000 Mules” were not actually mules were flawed because only one of the people shown in the film actually met Phillips’s “mule” standard anyway. (An email to Phillips asking him to identify which person was the mule did not receive a response by the time of publication though he later wrote to say the quote was “out of context.”)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The person shown in the movie before the guy on the bike, incidentally, was a woman who Engelbrecht claimed had visited “dozens and dozens” of drop boxes in both the 2020 presidential election and the Georgia Senate runoff in January 2021. So is she the sole mule? Or was Engelbrecht offering <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/even-geolocation-maps-2000-mules-are-misleading/?itid=lk_inline_manual_45' target='_blank'>another misrepresentation</a> to viewers? And if so, did D’Souza know?</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It’s because of things like this that reporters urge caution in viewing the movie or in taking Phillips’s claims at face value. And it’s because we urge caution that Phillips compares us to people who use violence to evoke fear.</p>"

But in no month during those two years were most checks not for handguns.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As you might expect, given that bit of data, most of the firearms manufactured in the United States in 2020 <a href='https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/afmer-2020-final-report-cover-sheet/download' target='_blank'>were handguns</a> — nearly 60 percent of the 11 million firearms produced in this country. When it comes to firearms used in crimes, handguns are far more common. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives <a href='https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2020' target='_blank'>found</a> that 80 percent of the 393,000 guns it recovered from crime scenes and traced were pistols or revolvers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A medical analogy is apt. Incidents like Uvalde are terrifying, acute manifestations of America’s unique gun culture. But the chronic problem is daily death at a smaller scale from people killing themselves or others, often by accident.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Ending incidents like the one in Uvalde is obviously important. But there would still be more than 100 gun deaths a day on average in the United States, most of them people taking their own lives.</p>"

He argued that Trump “has invoked Executive Privilege; and it is not my privilege to waive.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The House then <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/navarro-scavino-contempt-vote-house/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12' target='_blank'>voted in April</a> to hold Navarro and former White House communications chief Daniel Scavino Jr. in contempt of Congress, leading to criminal referrals to the Justice Department, which has the power to charge the two former officials with misdemeanors that can result in up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was trying to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election win.

A few weeks after the election was over, the first reports about that interference emerged, prompting Trump — smarting over having lost the popular vote — to disparage the idea that his victory was a function of anything other than his own aptitude. When BuzzFeed published the dossier of reports compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, Trump’s fury escalated. The Russia allegations were a “WITCH HUNT,” he wrote for the first time that same day. On the day following, he suggested that intelligence agencies had released the document, an act akin to “living in Nazi Germany.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was more than a week before he even became president.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Over time, a pattern emerged. Trump would make broad claims about how investigations into Russian interference — and, we later learned, contacts between his campaign team and Russian actors — were contrived to damage him personally. His allies would then scramble to prove him right either in the abstract or to validate the specific claims he had made, however loosely they could.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>And over and over and over those efforts to cast Trump as the victim of a plot aimed at undermining his candidacy or his presidency came up short.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Two things bear mentioning at the outset. It is true that the investigation into Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team suffered from flaws and errors. It’s quite possible that no massive investigation could escape some level of error of the sorts exposed by the scrutiny paid to the Russia investigation, but it is true that the scrutiny paid here did reveal questionable actions and decisions that don’t alter our understanding of what occurred.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The other thing worth mentioning is that the details were never the point. Trump’s play from the outset was to raise doubt and then simply refit the evidence as needed. His supporters always champion how he turned out to be “right” about various things, a function of ignoring all the times he was obviously wrong — the kid guessing a number between 1 and 10 who guesses each number and then claims he nailed it. The operating assumption is that Trump is right about being unfairly targeted by the Russia probe and so any new claim that bolsters that assumption is elevated — even after being debunked — until a new, not-yet-debunked claim emerges.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>What triggered the Russia investigation is simple. Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election both through the much-hyped but less-significant effort to contribute to the social media conversation and through the hacking of the Democratic Party and a top adviser to Hillary Clinton. As this was known to be going on, federal investigators began investigating whether people close to Trump might have been actively working with Russia. People like Paul Manafort, his campaign manager and consultant to Russia-linked actors; and like Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser who had previously been identified as a target for Russian intelligence efforts and who traveled to Moscow in early July 2016; and like George Papadopoulos, another adviser who had been told by a guy who was helping him set up a meeting between Trump and Russia’s president that Russia had some of Clinton’s emails. That Russia had hacked the Democrats was known by mid-June 2016 and the Russia probe was opened by the end of July.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the years since, that simple explanation for the investigation has been muddied by a variety of alternate theories, claims that objective analysis has shown to be either false or irrelevant to the central question.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>These are those claims.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One of the first egregious claims Trump made about the Russia investigation was that it involved having the “wires tapped” at Trump Tower during the campaign. This would become a pattern: Trump would take <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/14/why-trump-is-once-again-claiming-that-he-was-spied-upon-2016/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>an overblown claim</a> from conservative media and inflate it further. (There is no evidence that Trump Tower was wiretapped; the government has repeatedly denied that it did so.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Within days, Trump was <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/29/the-nunes-white-house-question-assessed-minute-by-minute/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21' target='_blank'>claiming</a> that his unfounded assertion was proved right not by evidence of wiretapping but by evidence that communications involving a member of his transition team, Michael Flynn, had been “unmasked” by the administration of Barack Obama. It’s always been odd to try to conflate this with wiretapping Trump Tower unless you recognize the intermediate step: Trump Tower was wiretapped, meaning that Trump was spied on, meaning that anyone working with Trump being spied on validates the claim. This is how it works.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The “Flynn unmasking” argument was clunky, too, because it depended on understanding how surveillance works. The government monitors communications with people like the Russian ambassador. But since the CIA and NSA aren’t supposed to surveil American citizens, the identities of Americans talking to the ambassador are “masked,” which is to say anonymized. Other officials can ask that the identity be unmasked, however, to understand who’s talking to that ambassador in the first place. Which Obama officials did, learning the person talking to Russia’s ambassador was Flynn. (Incidentally, Flynn had visited Moscow in late 2015, sitting with Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696' target='_blank'>at a dinner</a>.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was trumpeted repeatedly as the Obama administration spying on Flynn and, therefore, Trump. But a review from Trump’s own Justice Department later determined that there was <a href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/heres-the-doj-report-finding-that-obama-officials-didnt' target='_blank'>no evidence</a> that the unmasking was politically motivated. That Flynn later lied to investigators about the conversation, though, led to his pleading guilty to making false statements.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Shortly after the “unmasking” brouhaha, Trump’s irritation about the Russia probe led him to fire FBI Director James B. Comey (though Trump claimed this was about how the FBI handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server). Shortly thereafter, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was assigned to investigate Russian interference and possible overlap with Trump’s campaign team — an assignment made by a Trump appointee aimed at protecting the investigation from interference.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the public sphere, the dossier published by BuzzFeed had attracted outsize attention, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28' target='_blank'>despite obvious questions</a> about what it alleged. Most media outlets treated it with skepticism or treated it as unconfirmed. As time passed and many of its claims remained unsubstantiated or had been undermined, it gained unexpected importance — among Trump’s <i>defenders</i>. After all, if the dossier could be identified as the primary trigger for the Russia probe and it was contrived, that made the entire investigation dubious.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This line of argument became more appealing after it was learned that Steele had been hired by a firm called Fusion GPS that was itself hired by a law firm working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party. The line of argument skipped a few middle steps to become that Clinton had paid for a dossier of false claims — perhaps itself seeded by Russian intelligence! — and triggered the Russia probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The problem is that this assertion both ignores the known predicates for the Russia probe, and it doesn’t fit with the timeline of when the probe began. The FBI didn’t obtain the dossier until <a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'>mid-September 2016</a>, according to an internal inspector general report, after the Russia investigation was already underway.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In 2018, it was revealed that the dossier had been an important part of an application to obtain a warrant surveilling Carter Page. That warrant, obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), included allegations from the dossier as a reason to surveil him. (The application acknowledged that Steele was “was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit” Trump’s campaign.) The warrant was granted and later renewed several times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Only after Page left the campaign, however. When allegations from the Steele dossier were made public (apparently by Steele), Page resigned from the campaign. It was after that point that the surveillance warrant was granted. This problem with the timeline has been attributed to some multidimensional chess — that the warrant was a back door to investigate others close to Trump, for example — but that Page had previously been identified by a Russian intelligence agent as <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/15/politics/russia-spy-recruitment-tactics-fbi-carter-page/index.html' target='_blank'>a possible recruitment target</a> seems salient.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The dossier’s allegations have by now been <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/23/steele-dossier-igor-danchenko-indictment-scrutiny/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35' target='_blank'>shown to not be credible</a>. There are valid questions about including its claims in the FISA warrant. But neither that warrant nor the dossier itself were predicates for the Russia investigation itself. For years, Trump and his allies have claimed that the Russia investigation stemmed from the dossier <i>because</i> it was sketchy and <i>because</i> it was paid for indirectly by lawyers working for Clinton. But that doesn’t make it true.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>A few months after Mueller took over the Russia investigation, we learned that an FBI officials working on his team had been removed. That official, Peter Strzok, was a counterintelligence officer who had also been central to launching Crossfire Hurricane — the internal code name for the Russia investigation — in the first place. He was removed by Mueller after it was discovered that he had exchanged messages disparaging Trump and other elected officials with another FBI official, Lisa Page.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Those messages launched a slew of arguments aimed at undermining the Russia investigation broadly. Strzok was accused of ginning up the probe out of animus toward Trump, a belief that a later investigation by the Justice Department inspector general <a href='https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf' target='_blank'>found to be unwarranted</a>. His exchange with Page in which he referred to the need to probe possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia as being akin to a young person getting an “insurance policy” was repeatedly cited as evidence he wanted to blackmail Trump — although he <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/14/what-strzok-page-insurance-policy-text-was-actually-about/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40' target='_blank'>explained credibly under oath</a> that he was simply stating that they couldn’t allow the possibility of a connection to go unexamined in the event that Trump  won (which at the time seemed unlikely).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The huge trove of messages (which, despite a different set of rumors, were <a href='https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-8227360079' target='_blank'>not intentionally destroyed</a>) allowed for Trump supporters to pick out various phrases as sinister or significant even when they weren’t. There was a brief flurry of attention paid to <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/24/russia-probe-theories-that-trump-has-empowered-barr-investigate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41' target='_blank'>a message about “OCONUS lures”</a> — an apparent reference to informants outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). But this was part of Strzok’s job and was not shown to be related to the Russia probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That particular idea gained some traction after it was revealed that the FBI had <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is-no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43' target='_blank'>employed a confidential informant</a> to probe members of Trump’s team. This was dubbed Spygate and became Trump’s new explanation for how he was right about having been under surveillance all along. (Trump <a href='https://apnews.com/23b9456c12484b6cb31c93da269a6159/Seething-over-Russia-probe,-Trump-tears-into-%27spygate' target='_blank'>told an ally</a> that he liked to call the informant a “spy” specifically for the pejorative connotations.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>That informant, though, reached out to Carter Page and George Papadopoulos only after they were already on the FBI’s radar screen. That same inspector general report determined that there was “no evidence that the FBI used CHSs” — confidential human sources — “or UCEs” — undercover employees — “to interact with members of the Trump campaign prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“After the opening of the investigation,” it continues, “we found no evidence that the FBI placed any CHSs or UCEs within the Trump campaign or tasked any CHSs or UCEs to report on the Trump campaign.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As should be obvious, that inspector general report did a lot to undercut the narratives promoted by Trump and his allies. So, as soon as it came out, Attorney General William P. Barr released a statement in concert with U.S. Attorney John Durham <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/us/politics/barr-durham-ig-report-russia-investigation.html' target='_blank'>undercutting its determinations</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>By then, Durham had already been tapped to conduct an investigation into the investigation: to figure out whether Trump’s efforts to cast himself as unfairly targeted held water. The inspector general report, by making an objective assessment that it didn’t, stepped on Durham’s (and therefore Barr’s and therefore Trump’s) toes, hence the statement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Durham and Barr began scouring the available evidence, going so far as to <a href='https://www.thedailybeast.com/barr-went-to-rome-to-hear-a-secret-tape-from-joseph-mifsud-the-professor-who-helped-ignite-the-russia-probe' target='_blank'>travel to Italy</a> to evaluate whether the understood predicate for the investigation — Papadopoulos being told that Russia had Clinton emails — was valid. But, for months, no alternate explanation emerged.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Before Trump left office, Durham’s role was shifted to special counsel, giving him the same protection from President Biden that Mueller had from Trump. But Durham has not produced much. He obtained an <a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/russian-national-indicted-making-false-statements-fbi' target='_blank'>indictment</a> against Igor Danchenko, one of the sources for the Steele dossier and one <a href='https://www.justice.gov/sco/pr/grand-jury-indicts-dc-attorney-making-false-statements-fbi-2016-regarding-alleged' target='_blank'>against an attorney</a> who worked for the law firm employed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Which brings us to this week.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In October 2020, the campaign looming, the political ally Trump put in charge of the national intelligence directorate <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'>released a lette</a><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trumpworlds-latest-effort-undermine-russia-probe-may-be-even-less-substantive-than-prior-attempts/?itid=lk_inline_manual_57' target='_blank'>r</a> pointedly suggesting that the Russia investigation was a function of Clinton’s campaign. The evidence? Apparently that the CIA had identified discussion among Russian sources alleging that Clinton had approved a campaign message trying to link Trump to Russia on July 26, 2016.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>This was, in fact, five days before Crossfire Hurricane was launched. But it was after there were already <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/the-trump-russia-money-question-in-24-steps/?itid=lk_inline_manual_58' target='_blank'>numerous public questions</a> about Trump’s connections to and sympathies toward Russia and Putin. That Russia got intelligence that Clinton had made linking Trump to Russia part of her campaign strategy in late July is both unremarkable (her campaign manager, Robby Mook, had already raised it in television interviews) and unrelated to the FBI probe.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The appeal here is obvious, though, as it was with the Steele dossier. Blaming Clinton for the Russia probe scratches two itches at once: casts Trump as innocent and Clinton as guilty.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Durham’s indictment of Michael Sussman, the attorney who worked for the firm hired by Clinton’s campaign, prompted a flurry of similar allegations. He had come to the FBI with <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?itid=lk_inline_manual_60' target='_blank'>a dubious claim</a> about a connection between Trump’s private company and a Russian bank — which to Trump supporters became proof that Clinton had tried to gin up this controversy and therefore the Russia probe. But that allegation was incidental to the Russia investigation (far more even than the Carter Page FISA warrant), coming months after the investigation began. During Sussman’s trial, Mook testified that Clinton had approved a messaging campaign elevating the dubious claim, an admission that titillated Fox News types. But it was completely irrelevant to the Russia investigation. Like the October 2020 story, it was about campaign messaging, not federal investigations.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The Sussman prosecution included other efforts to elevate minor points as dispositive of Trump’s having been unfairly targeted. There was the flutter of excitement over the Trump White House having been surveilled by Sussman as <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/18/john-durham-dumps-small-bucket-water-forest-fire-he-sparked/?itid=lk_inline_manual_61' target='_blank'>hinted at in a Durham court filing</a> — but that didn’t happen. Instead, researchers who were clients of Sussman’s had obtained data from the White House during the Obama administration that they had analyzed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>One would think that, by that point, Trump’s allies would be skeptical of new assertions about how the Russia investigation began. After all, not only have there been repeated claims about what happened that have been shown to be baseless, but there also has been nothing that has undercut the official story about how the probe began (even after Barr and Durham went to Italy in the apparent hope of doing so).</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But, again, the point isn’t the evidence. The point is the belief that Trump was unfairly accused. That belief is not driven by evidence, so it can’t be undercut by a lack of evidence.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>It is still important to note that there is no evidence for it. And not for lack of trying to find some.</p>"

(Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI about these calls.) And there were valid questions early on about the Obama administration’s use of unmasking, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/04/susan-rice-isnt-a-smoking-gun-but-she-does-have-some-explaining-to-do/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9' target='_blank'>as we wrote in 2017</a>.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>But the allegations almost always went beyond the known facts.

Robert Wallach, a California lawyer who came to Washington in the early 1980s as an adviser to presidential counselor Edwin Meese III, only to become a central figure in the Reagan-era Wedtech bribery scandal, in which he was first convicted and later freed after defending himself in court, died May 15 at his home in Alameda, Calif. He was 88.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The death was announced by the San Francisco law firm of Rains Lucia Stern, where Mr. Wallach worked in recent years. The cause was not disclosed.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Early in his career, Mr. Wallach established a reputation as one of California’s top trial lawyers, winning the state’s first million-dollar settlement in a medical malpractice case, followed by a $3.6 million verdict in New Mexico, after a child suffered brain damage at birth.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In San Francisco, he was known as a liberal Democrat who briefly sought the U.S. Senate nomination in 1976 as a supporter of gay rights and legalized marijuana. By 1980, Mr. Wallach had become a supporter of the presidential campaign of Republican Ronald Reagan, largely because of his friendship with Meese, one of Reagan’s top advisers. Meese had been Mr. Wallach’s law school classmate and moot court partner at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After Reagan’s election, Mr. Wallach came to Washington as an informal adviser to Meese, who was counselor to the president before becoming attorney general in 1985.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was named a U.S. Representative for Human Rights and served on the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, but beyond sharing lunches and memos with Meese, he exercised little real authority.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Early in 1981, Mr. Wallach became the conduit to the Reagan administration for Wedtech, a small manufacturing firm in the Bronx seeking leverage on Pentagon projects. The company’s owners, unschooled in the ways of Washington, had hired a private detective to find out why they weren’t winning defense contracts.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I didn’t think investigating the secretary of the Army and some procurement officers was going to help,” the detective, Harold Lipset, told The Washington Post in 1987. “I thought they needed a lobbyist in Washington and [Mr. Wallach] was the only one I knew who knew somebody in Washington.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach, who had spent his early years in New York City, saw the company’s blue-collar executives as the kind of scrappy underdogs he had been as a young man.

Several political figures were also swept up in the widening scandal, including Mr. Wallach, former White House communications director <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2006/03/28/strategist-reagan-adviser-lyn-nofziger/7b36b6f6-2b87-415a-b7a6-eabe5e94d392/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18' target='_blank'>Lyn Nofziger</a> and members of Congress.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>In the end, more than 20 people were convicted in federal court. U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and former Bronx borough president Stanley Simon each spent more than two years in prison on corruption charges. Meese was not prosecuted, but in the midst of the scandal he resigned from his post as attorney general in 1988.</p><p></p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was convicted of racketeering in 1989 and sentenced to six years in prison, leading to the temporary suspension of his law practice in California while he appealed the decision. His conviction was overturned in 1991, after a key witness was found to have committed perjury. (Nofziger and others similarly had their convictions reversed.)</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Still, Mr. Wallach’s legal troubles were not over, and in 1993 he faced a new trial in New York on similar charges. He refused to make a plea deal, maintaining he had never committed a crime in promoting Wedtech to federal officials.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Having spent more than $1 million on his defense and still owing more than $700,000, Mr. Wallach was reduced to acting as his own attorney almost out of desperation.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“If I get convicted a second time, I have nothing left,” he said. “I will lose everything, including my livelihood.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>When the arguments were finished, the deadlocked jury could not reach a decision. The judge dismissed all charges against Mr. Wallach, who went back to San Francisco to rebuild his career.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Eugene Robert Wallach was born on April 11, 1934, in New York City. His parents worked in a hat factory and divorced when their son was 7.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where she worked in an airplane assembly plant during World War II.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach was a champion debater in high school and graduated in 1955 from the University of Southern California. As a law student at Berkeley, he became especially close to Meese, as they studied together in the Meese family basement.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“I used to love going to their home,” he told journalist James Traub for his 1990 book about the Wedtech scandal, “Too Good to Be True.” “Ed and I were writing briefs down in the basement, his mother would come down with the sandwiches. It was right out of ‘Andy Hardy.’ It was the kind of home I had never experienced.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After graduating in 1958, Mr. Wallach joined a San Francisco law firm, then called Walkup &amp; Downing, and soon became recognized as a top courtroom advocate. He established a solo practice in 1971 and was known for a string of victories, often in cases involving accidents or medical malpractice. One of his courtroom victories, involving Girl Scouts burned in a car crash, led to the adoption of median barriers on some California highways.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“He was known as being the best lawyer in the courtroom in front of a jury,” Eustace de St. Phalle, a partner at Rains Lucia Stern, said in an interview. “He was always listening and was a great strategist.”</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>As Mr. Wallach’s legal reputation grew, he cultivated an air of eccentricity: He became known as “e. bob” — spelling his name without capital letters — and often went out in public with an exotic Saluki dog. He wore a yellow rose in his lapel.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>He was married two times, to Barbara Wallach and later to Glenda Jones. Survivors include three daughters from his first marriage and seven grandchildren.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After returning to San Francisco, Mr. Wallach represented the Fang family as it purchased the San Francisco Examiner newspaper in 2000 from the Hearst company. He was also the longtime corporate counsel of the Sharper Image retail firm.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Mr. Wallach taught at several Bay Area law schools and was an informal mentor to countless lawyers. He joined Rains Lucia Stern in 2016 and continued to practice law through 2019. According to the firm, he tried 283 cases that reached a verdict — and lost only 14 times.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>“The only thing I’m guilt-ridden about,” Mr. Wallach said in 1993, “is my stupidity and poor judgment in venturing off into the minefields of Washington.”</p>"

She was 94.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Her son Kurt Wurzberger confirmed her death and said he did not know the cause.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>The daughter of a Democratic congressman and then senator from Idaho, Mrs. Reynolds came of age in Washington in the 1930s and ’40s, a time when most women could scarcely imagine pursuing professional lives like the one she eventually achieved.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>Her career began in the 1950s on a dare. Then the mother of several young sons, she accepted a challenge from an acquaintance to try out for an on-air job at WBAL-TV in Baltimore, according to <a href='https://www.washingtonian.com/2007/06/01/golden-girl/' target='_blank'>a profile</a> published in Washingtonian magazine in 2007. The job was hers.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>By the 1960s, she was co-anchoring the evening news on a television station in San Francisco. She also covered politics and interviewed Ronald Reagan when the former Hollywood actor ran for California governor in 1966, making the connection that would shape much of the rest of her life.</p><p data-qa='drop-cap-letter' data-el='text' class='font-copy font--article-body gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md'>After winning the gubernatorial election that year, Reagan hired Mrs. Reynolds as an assistant press secretary and later special assistant.

The Clark side of the family produced two Democratic governors of Idaho in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Barzilla Clark and Chase Clark. An uncle on Mrs. Reynolds’s maternal side, Robert E. Smylie, was a Republican who served as Idaho governor from 1955 to 1967. (Mrs. Reynolds, for her part, told Washingtonian that she became a Republican after interviewing <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm?itid=lk_inline_manual_26' target='_blank'>Sen.
