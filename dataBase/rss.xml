    <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/first-amendment' target='_blank'&gt;religious freedom firm First Liberty&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter Tuesday to the City of Palatka, Florida, defending the use of public funds to restore a church's Olympic-sized pool after a secularist group claimed the move would violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;'The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution permits religious organizations to receive generally available government benefits like the funds at issue here,' Keisha Russell and Ryan Gardner, &lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court' target='_blank'&gt;lawyers with the firm&lt;/a&gt; First Liberty Institute, wrote in the letter, provided to Fox News Digital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Moveover, the Free Exercise Clause forbids the type of religious discrimination proposed by [the Freedom From Religion Foundation] FFRF whereby otherwise qualified religious organizations would be excluded because of their religious character or identity,' they &lt;a href='https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/Palatka-Letter-Signed_Redacted.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;added in the letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Liberty lawyers represent &lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity' target='_blank'&gt;Calvary Missionary Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;, which recently applied for a $35,000 grant to restore the indoor, junior Olympic swimming pool located in its Family Life Center in order to reopen the pool freely for the community's use and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/boston-school-board-church-school-religious-discrimination' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON-AREA SCHOOL BOARD APPROVES CHURCH'S PRIVATE SCHOOL AFTER ACCUSATION OF ‘RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFRF had previously &lt;a href='https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/FFRF-Palatka-Letter.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;sent a letter warning&lt;/a&gt; that the grant would violate the Establishment Clause. 'The Center would undoubtedly use its pool to entice those in the community to come to the Center where it could then recruit them to join the Church,' FFRF staff attorney Christopher Line wrote in the letter, dated May 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div source='' class='image-ct inline'&gt;&lt;div class='m'&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1470/828/Family-Life-Center-pic.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt;&lt;source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1862/1048/Family-Life-Center-pic.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt; &lt;img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/640/320/Family-Life-Center-pic.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Family Life Center in Palatka, Florida.'&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class='caption'&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;!----&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;'While we certainly understand why the City would see value in helping to provide a pool for its community, it cannot use city funds to essentially repair a church’s pool,' Line wrote. 'Taxpayer funds should not be used to help a church recruit the City’s children, and the Church’s request should be denied.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Our Constitution’s Establishment Clause—which protects Americans’ religious freedom by ensuring the continued separation of religion and government—dictates that the government cannot in any way endorse religion,' the FFRF attorney argued. He claimed that the Constitution prohibits any 'sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,' citing Walz v. NY Tax Commission (1970, along with Tilton v. Richardson (1971) and other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Liberty lawyers cited a more recent Supreme Court case, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer (2017), in which a Christian church had applied for a generally available grant program to help resurface its playground, claiming that the benefits of a new playground surface would extend 'to the local community.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court ruled that the government could not require the church to be 'put to the choice between being a church and receiving a government benefit.' Russell and Gardner argued that the case is directly applicable to Calvary Missionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div source='' class='image-ct inline'&gt;&lt;div class='m'&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1470/828/Calvary-Baptist-Church.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt;&lt;source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1862/1048/Calvary-Baptist-Church.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt; &lt;img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/640/320/Calvary-Baptist-Church.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in Palatka, Florida.'&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class='caption'&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;span class='copyright'&gt;(Google Maps)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Liberty lawyers faulted FFRF for ignoring this and other relevant cases, while claiming that 'none of the cases cited by FFRF are controlling here.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the cases FFRF cited, Tilton v. Richardson, 'actually upheld neutral one-time grants to construct buildings at religious and non-religious colleges.' The lawyers argued that the Wirtz case does not apply to Calvary Missionary because 'it involved the sale of government property to a Catholic high school&lt;br&gt;for below-market value, not an application for a neutral government benefit.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many of the cases FFRF cited, including Wirtz, applied the three-part test the Court constructed in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), a test which the Supreme Court 'no longer applies' to cases examining 'government benefits and tax exemptions that go to religious organizations,' as Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained in his concurrence in American Legion v. American Humanist Association (2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div source='AP Newsroom' class='image-ct inline'&gt;&lt;div class='m'&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/06/1470/828/Court.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt;&lt;source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/06/1862/1048/Court.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt; &lt;img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/06/640/320/Court.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='The Supreme Court'&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class='caption'&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;span class='copyright'&gt;(AP Photo/J.

'Thus, consistent with this mandate of neutrality, the Supreme Court has long held that the Establishment Clause permits religious organizations to receive generally available government benefits.'&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!----&gt;]]&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;After at least 19 students at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, were killed Tuesday morning, a family member of one of the children killed is encouraging parents across the country to hold their own children close, as they never know when it will be the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;'For everybody else that has kids out here, cherish these moments just like your parents cherished you every day,' Benito Martinez, a family member of the deceased told Fox News.

    <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;Authorities identified Salvador Ramos as the shooter who &lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/us/uvalde-texas-robb-elementary-school-active-shooter' target='_blank'&gt;opened fire in Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuesday. The 18-year-old shot and killed at least 19 students and two teachers, Fox News confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott identified Ramos as the shooter and said the Uvalde local entered the school grounds and proceeded to open fire. Abbott also said the shooter is dead and is believed to have acted alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin told Fox News that during the shooting, Ramos became barricaded inside the elementary school. An agent with the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC), is believed to have shot and killed the suspected gunman. Two officers were shot and wounded on scene but were expected to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/uvalde-texas-school-shooting' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: LIVE UPDATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div source='' class='image-ct inline'&gt;&lt;div class='m'&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media='(max-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1470/828/Ramos-Texas.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt;&lt;source media='(min-width: 767px)' srcset='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/1862/1048/Ramos-Texas.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x'&gt; &lt;img src='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/640/320/Ramos-Texas.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1' alt='Image of Salvador Ramos'&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class='caption'&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The Instagram account has since been taken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same account allegedly sent alarming messages to a woman before the deadly attack. The first message, sent on May 12, asked, 'You gonna repost my gun pics?'

    <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;A mass shooting at a Texas elementary school killed 19 children and two teachers Tuesday and the suspected gunman was killed, &lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/greg-abbott' target='_blank'&gt;Gov. Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='speakable'&gt;Abbott identified the suspect as Salvador Ramos, a &lt;a href='https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas' target='_blank'&gt;Uvalde resident&lt;/a&gt;, who is also dead and acted alone, authorities said. He had a handgun and possibly a rifle when he opened fire at Robb Elementary School, he said. Two police officers were shot and wounded but were expected to survive, Abbott said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Texans across the state are grieving for the victims of this senseless crime and for the community of Uvalde.
